{"text":"Patients in stage III and IV were treated with 8 courses of chemotherapy with Adriamycin , VM26 , Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone , given in two different time schedules .","paragraph":"Results of an EORTC trial (20751) in non-Hodgkin lymphomas are presented. Patients were treated in the same way independent of the histological type. There were 468 patients in the study of whom 124 patients were in stage I (85% 5 year survival), 57 in stage II (55%), 121 in stage III (55%) and 166 in stage IV (45%). Using the Kiel classification the low grade lymphomas were subdivided into two categories: those with a follicular (80% 5 year survival) and with a diffuse cell pattern (50% 5 year survival) with an intermediate prognosis compared with the high grade lymphomas (35% 5 year survival). Treatment was stratified according to stage. In stage I regional radiotherapy was given followed by randomization for maintenance chemotherapy with Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone. No influence in survival was seen (85% at 5 years), although disease free survival was better in the maintenance chemotherapy group (75% vs 55% at 5 years). In stage II regional radiotherapy was followed, after randomization, by transdiaphragmatic irradiation, all patients received maintenance chemotherapy. The group was too small to draw conclusions about the effect of this treatment. Primary radiotherapy in stage II disease with diffuse histology gave bad results.<b><i>Patients in stage III and IV were treated with 8 courses of chemotherapy with Adriamycin , VM26 , Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone , given in two different time schedules .</i></b> Iceberg radiation was then given to areas with initially large or slowly responding disease. All patients had maintenance chemotherapy. No difference was found for the 2 chemotherapy schedules in remission rate, disease free interval and survival. In stage III and IV patients with a follicular lymphoma have a longer relapse free interval and total survival (39% and 68% at 5 years) compared with those with a lymphoma diffuse histology (19 and 30% at 5 years). Patients with stage IV disease due to bone marrow involvement only had a better prognosis compared with stage IV disease for other reasons.","tokens":[{"text":"Patients","start":0,"end":8,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":8,"end":10,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"stage","start":11,"end":16,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"III","start":17,"end":20,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":21,"end":24,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"IV","start":25,"end":27,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"were","start":28,"end":32,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"treated","start":33,"end":40,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":41,"end":45,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"8","start":46,"end":47,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"courses","start":48,"end":55,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":56,"end":58,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"chemotherapy","start":59,"end":71,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":72,"end":76,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"Adriamycin","start":77,"end":87,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":88,"end":89,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"VM26","start":90,"end":94,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":95,"end":96,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"Cyclophosphamide","start":97,"end":113,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":114,"end":117,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"Prednisone","start":118,"end":128,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":129,"end":130,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"given","start":131,"end":136,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":137,"end":139,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"two","start":140,"end":143,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"different","start":144,"end":153,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"time","start":154,"end":158,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"schedules","start":159,"end":168,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":169,"end":170,"id":28,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":97,"end":113,"token_start":18,"token_end":18,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":118,"end":128,"token_start":20,"token_end":20,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":652592461,"_task_hash":1394874966,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"answer":"accept"}

The rats were divided into group 1 (normal control), group 2 (DCM), group 3 (DCM plus carvedilol 8 mg/kg/day bid orally), and group 4 (DCM plus losartan 20 mg/kg/day orally). All rats were sacrificed on day 90 following DCM induction. The results indicated that connexin43 protein expression and mRNA expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha, endo-thelial nitric oxide synthase, and interleukin-10 were significantly lower, whereas mRNA expressions of endothelin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were significantly higher in group 2 than in groups 1, 3, and 4 in LV myocardium (all P < 0.05). Additionally, cytochrome C levels in LV myocardium and LV contractility were significantly lower, whereas fibrosis area, cellular apoptosis, and mitochondrial oxidative response of LV myocardium were significantly higher in group 2 than in groups 1, 3, and 4 (all P < 0.005). In conclusion, losartan is comparable to carvedilol in attenuating inflammation, oxidative response, myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis, as well as in preserving energy transcription factors and LV function in DCM.","tokens":[{"text":"Comparison","start":0,"end":10,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":10,"end":12,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"losartan","start":13,"end":21,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":22,"end":25,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"carvedilol","start":26,"end":36,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":37,"end":39,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"attenuating","start":40,"end":51,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"inflammatory","start":52,"end":64,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":65,"end":68,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"oxidative","start":69,"end":78,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"response","start":79,"end":87,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":88,"end":91,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"preserving","start":92,"end":102,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"energy","start":103,"end":109,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"transcription","start":110,"end":123,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"factors","start":124,"end":131,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":132,"end":135,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"left","start":136,"end":140,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"ventricular","start":141,"end":152,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"function","start":153,"end":161,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":162,"end":164,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"dilated","start":165,"end":172,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"cardiomyopathy","start":173,"end":187,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"rats","start":188,"end":192,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":193,"end":194,"id":24,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":13,"end":21,"token_start":2,"token_end":2,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":26,"end":36,"token_start":4,"token_end":4,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":-338306782,"_task_hash":1058547023,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"config":{"block":[{"view_id":"relations"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\" onclick=\"contextClicked()\">Click to get full context</button><div class=\"content\" style=\"display: none;text-align:left;\">{{{paragraph}}}</div>"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"proceed()\">Proceed to choice questions</button>"}]},"answer":"accept"}

The results showed that tetracycline/tigecycline had significant lower affinity to PAC1-EC1 than doxycycline/minocycline, which was consistent with their non-positive allosteric modulation activity on PAC1-R. Furthermore, by comparing the key residues contributing to the PAM binding with the predicted allosteric site in PAC1-EC1, we characterized four motifs contributing to PAM binding in PAC1-EC1. The site-directed mutation results showed that ASN60 played the most important role in the PAM binding of the small-molecule antibiotics, while ASP116 played a sensitive marginal role in the PAM binding. These results not only help to explain the clinical and experimental neuroprotective effects of doxycycline/minocycline, but also help to characterize the PAM binding site in PAC1-EC1, which will promote the screening and characterization of novel small-molecule PAMs targeting PAC1-EC1 with drug development potency in nerve system disease.","tokens":[{"text":"Based","start":0,"end":5,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":5,"end":7,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"our","start":8,"end":11,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"previous","start":12,"end":20,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"data","start":21,"end":25,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"showing","start":26,"end":33,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":34,"end":38,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"doxycycline","start":39,"end":50,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":51,"end":54,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"minocycline","start":55,"end":66,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"work","start":67,"end":71,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":72,"end":74,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":75,"end":78,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"positive","start":79,"end":87,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"allosteric","start":88,"end":98,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"modulator","start":99,"end":108,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":109,"end":110,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"PAM","start":111,"end":114,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":115,"end":116,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":117,"end":119,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"PAC1-R","start":120,"end":126,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":127,"end":128,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"we","start":129,"end":131,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"used","start":132,"end":136,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"computer","start":137,"end":145,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"molecular","start":146,"end":155,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"docking","start":156,"end":163,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":164,"end":167,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"isothermal","start":168,"end":178,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"titration","start":179,"end":188,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"calorimetry","start":189,"end":200,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"assay","start":201,"end":206,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":207,"end":209,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"further","start":210,"end":217,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"determine","start":218,"end":227,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":228,"end":231,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"bindings","start":232,"end":240,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":241,"end":243,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"doxycycline/minocycline","start":244,"end":267,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"'s","start":268,"end":270,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"derivatives","start":271,"end":282,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"including","start":283,"end":292,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"tetracycline/tigecycline","start":293,"end":317,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":318,"end":322,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":323,"end":326,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"N-terminal","start":327,"end":337,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"extracellular","start":338,"end":351,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"domain","start":352,"end":358,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":359,"end":361,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"PAC1-R","start":362,"end":368,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":369,"end":370,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"PAC1-EC1","start":371,"end":379,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":380,"end":381,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":382,"end":383,"id":53,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":39,"end":50,"token_start":7,"token_end":7,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":55,"end":66,"token_start":9,"token_end":9,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":761620698,"_task_hash":424667154,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"config":{"block":[{"view_id":"relations"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\" onclick=\"contextClicked()\">Click to get full context</button><div class=\"content\" style=\"display: none;text-align:left;\">{{{paragraph}}}</div>"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"proceed()\">Proceed to choice questions</button>"}]},"answer":"accept"}

{"text":"All of the S.pyogenes isolates were susceptible to penicillin G , cefotaxime , ceftriaxone , chloramphenicol , clindamycin , erythromycin , levofloxacin , vancomycin and linezolid .","paragraph":"Streptococcus pyogenes is an important bacterial pathogen that colonizes the throat and skin of human beings and causes a wide variety of diseases ranging from mild infections like pharyngitis, tonsillitis and impetigo to severe invasive infections such streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, septicemia, and necrotizing fasciitis, and produces a wide variety of virulence factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic resistance, virulence genes; [pyrogenic exotoxin genes (speA, C, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, smeZ and ssa), deoxyribonuclease genes (sdaB, spd3, sdc ve sdaD), protease genes (speB, spyCEP ve scpA) and inhibitor genes (mac and sic)] of S.pyogenes strains isolated from throat cultures of patients with symptomatic tonsillo-pharyngitis and typing by multiple locus variable number tandem repeat fingerprinting (MLVF) method. One hundred and fifty S.pyogenes isolates were identified by conventional methods and streptococcus group A latex kit (Biomerieux, France). Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. DNA isolation was performed by using a commercial DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Germany) in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. The virulence genes were determined by multiplex PCR. MLVF method was performed with multiplex PCR using specific primers for repeated sequences within bacterial genome.<b><i>All of the S.pyogenes isolates were susceptible to penicillin G , cefotaxime , ceftriaxone , chloramphenicol , clindamycin , erythromycin , levofloxacin , vancomycin and linezolid .</i></b> Among streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin genes the most frequent gene was smeZ (90.0%) followed by speG (88.0%), speC (58.7%), ssa (42.7%), speA (33.3%), speJ (24.0%), speK (18.7%), speH (14.0%), speI (13.3%), speL and speM (9.3%). Of the DNase genes, sdaB was detected in all strains (100%), spd3, sdc, sdaD genes were determined as 64.7%, 36.0%, 24.7% respectively. Protease genes (speB, spyCEP, scpA) and mac gene from the inhibitor genes were positive in all strains, and sic gene was positive in only 3 (2.0%) of the isolates. Thirty-two different patterns that contained two or more isolates were determined by MLVF analysis. Ninety one isolates were included in any of the 32 different patterns, while 59 isolates were defined as sporadic isolates. In conclusion, S.pyogenes isolates collected from throat cultures of patients with symptomatic tonsillo-pharyngitis in Konya/Turkey were susceptible to all antibiotics studied and have carried a very high rate of virulence factors. However the isolates were mostly clonally unrelated and sporadic. This study is the first report in Turkey, in which S.pyogenes isolates were typed by the MLVF method and a large number of virulence factors were investigated.","tokens":[{"text":"All","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":3,"end":5,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":6,"end":9,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"S.pyogenes","start":10,"end":20,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"isolates","start":21,"end":29,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"were","start":30,"end":34,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"susceptible","start":35,"end":46,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":47,"end":49,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"penicillin","start":50,"end":60,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"G","start":61,"end":62,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":63,"end":64,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"cefotaxime","start":65,"end":75,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":76,"end":77,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"ceftriaxone","start":78,"end":89,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":90,"end":91,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"chloramphenicol","start":92,"end":107,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":108,"end":109,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"clindamycin","start":110,"end":121,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":122,"end":123,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"erythromycin","start":124,"end":136,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":137,"end":138,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"levofloxacin","start":139,"end":151,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":152,"end":153,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"vancomycin","start":154,"end":164,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":165,"end":168,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"linezolid","start":169,"end":178,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":179,"end":180,"id":26,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":65,"end":75,"token_start":11,"token_end":11,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":78,"end":89,"token_start":13,"token_end":13,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":92,"end":107,"token_start":15,"token_end":15,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":110,"end":121,"token_start":17,"token_end":17,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":124,"end":136,"token_start":19,"token_end":19,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":139,"end":151,"token_start":21,"token_end":21,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":154,"end":164,"token_start":23,"token_end":23,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":169,"end":178,"token_start":25,"token_end":25,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":-1474972273,"_task_hash":1837175967,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"config":{"block":[{"view_id":"relations"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\" onclick=\"contextClicked()\">Click to get full context</button><div class=\"content\" style=\"display: none;text-align:left;\">{{{paragraph}}}</div>"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"proceed()\">Proceed to choice questions</button>"}]},"answer":"accept"}

The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBICs), and antibiotic synergy by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index were determined for the following antibiotics: ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, netilmicin and clarithromycin. A total of 14 (23.3%) isolates out of 60 isolates of P. aeruginosa were biofilm positive. Cefepime, imipenem and meropenem had the lowest MIC 90 values.

Moreover, high expression of cdc7 and RNA polymerase II Subunit A (POLR2A), the direct target of CDK9, is significantly correlated with poor metastasis-free survival in a cohort of breast cancer patients. RNA sequencing revealed marked downregulation of pathways governing proliferation, transcription and cell survival in TNBC cells treated with the combination of an EGFR-TKI and a dual cdc7/CDK9 inhibitor.

Preliminary findings of the PRIME-NET study suggest that the addition of MET to treatment with everolimus (EVE) and/or somatostatin analogs (SSAs) can provide clinical benefit in diabetic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. In light of this and other retrospective evidence of MET's anticancer activity in NETs, prospective studies are needed.

{"text":"The DPP-4 inhibitors sitagliptin and vildagliptin are generally weight neutral , with less marked gastrointestinal adverse effects than the GLP-1 receptor agonists .","paragraph":"Oral therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus, when used appropriately, can safely assist patients to achieve glycaemic targets in the short to medium term. However, the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes usually requires a combination of two or more oral agents in the longer term, often as a prelude to insulin therapy. Issues of safety and tolerability, notably weight gain, often limit the optimal application of anti-diabetic drugs such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Moreover, the impact of different drugs, even within a single class, on the risk of long-term vascular complications has come under scrutiny. For example, recent publication of evidence suggesting potential detrimental effects of rosiglitazone on myocardial events generated a heated debate and led to a reduction in use of this drug. In contrast, current evidence supports the view that pioglitazone has vasculoprotective properties. Both drugs are contraindicated in patients who are at risk of heart failure. An additional recently identified safety concern is an increased risk of fractures, especially in postmenopausal women.Several new drugs with glucose-lowering efficacy that may offer certain advantages have recently become available. These include (i) injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors; (ii) the amylin analogue pramlintide; and (iii) selective cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) antagonists. GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as exenatide, stimulate nutrient-induced insulin secretion and reduce inappropriate glucagon secretion while delaying gastric emptying and reducing appetite. These agents offer a low risk of hypoglycaemia combined with sustained weight loss.<b><i>The DPP-4 inhibitors sitagliptin and vildagliptin are generally weight neutral , with less marked gastrointestinal adverse effects than the GLP-1 receptor agonists .</i></b> Potential benefits of GLP-1 receptor stimulation on beta cell neogenesis are under investigation. Pancreatitis has been reported in exenatide-treated patients. Pramlintide, an injected peptide used in combination with insulin, can reduce insulin dose and bodyweight. The CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant promotes weight loss and has favourable effects on aspects of the metabolic syndrome, including the hyperglycaemia of type 2 diabetes. However, in 2007 the US FDA declined approval of rimonabant, requiring more data on adverse effects, notably depression. The future of dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha/gamma agonists, or glitazars, is presently uncertain following concerns about their safety.In conclusion, several new classes of drugs have recently become available in some countries that offer new options for treating type 2 diabetes. Beneficial or neutral effects on bodyweight are an attractive feature of the new drugs. However, the higher cost of these agents, coupled with an absence of long-term safety and clinical outcome data, need to be taken into consideration by clinicians and healthcare organizations.","tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"DPP-4","start":3,"end":8,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"inhibitors","start":9,"end":19,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"sitagliptin","start":20,"end":31,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":32,"end":35,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"vildagliptin","start":36,"end":48,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"are","start":49,"end":52,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"generally","start":53,"end":62,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"weight","start":63,"end":69,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"neutral","start":70,"end":77,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":78,"end":79,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":80,"end":84,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"less","start":85,"end":89,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"marked","start":90,"end":96,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"gastrointestinal","start":97,"end":113,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"adverse","start":114,"end":121,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"effects","start":122,"end":129,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"than","start":130,"end":134,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":135,"end":138,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"GLP-1","start":139,"end":144,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"receptor","start":145,"end":153,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"agonists","start":154,"end":162,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":163,"end":164,"id":22,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":20,"end":31,"token_start":3,"token_end":3,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":36,"end":48,"token_start":5,"token_end":5,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":877959331,"_task_hash":-523981597,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"config":{"block":[{"view_id":"relations"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\" onclick=\"contextClicked()\">Click to get full context</button><div class=\"content\" style=\"display: none;text-align:left;\">{{{paragraph}}}</div>"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"proceed()\">Proceed to choice questions</button>"}]},"answer":"accept"}

When fat accumulates, lipids are primarily stored as triglycerides which results in steatosis and provides substrates for lipid peroxidation. An in vitro multiparametric flow cytometry assay was performed in HepG2 cells by using fluorescent probes to analyze cell viability (propidium iodide, PI), lipid accumulation (BODIPY493/503), mitochondrial membrane potential (tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester, TMRM) and reactive oxygen species generation (ROS) (2',7'-dihydrochlorofluorescein diacetate, DHCF-DA) as functional markers. All the measurements were restricted to live cells by gating the cells that excluded PI or those that exhibited the typical forward and side scatter features of live cells. The assay was qualified by analyzing a number of selected model drugs with a well documented induction of steatosis in vivo using different mechanisms as positive controls and several non-steatosic compounds as negative controls. For the cytometric screening assay, the concentrations tested were up to the corresponding IC(10) value determined by the MTT assay. Among the parameters analyzed, increased BODIPY fluorescence was the most sensitive and selective marker of drug-induced steatosis. However, a more consistent predictive approach was the combination of two endpoints: lipid accumulation and ROS generation.<b><i>The assay correctly identified 100 % of steatosis-positive and steatosis-negative compounds , and a high steatosis risk was predicted for amiodarone , doxycycline , tetracycline and valproate treatments at therapeutic doses .</i></b> The results suggest that this cell-based assay may be a useful approach to identify the potential of drug candidates to induce steatosis.","tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"assay","start":3,"end":8,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"correctly","start":9,"end":18,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"identified","start":19,"end":29,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"100","start":30,"end":33,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"%","start":34,"end":35,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":36,"end":38,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"steatosis-positive","start":39,"end":57,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":58,"end":61,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"steatosis-negative","start":62,"end":80,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"compounds","start":81,"end":90,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":91,"end":92,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":93,"end":96,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":97,"end":98,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"high","start":99,"end":103,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"steatosis","start":104,"end":113,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"risk","start":114,"end":118,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":119,"end":122,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"predicted","start":123,"end":132,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":133,"end":136,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"amiodarone","start":137,"end":147,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":148,"end":149,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"doxycycline","start":150,"end":161,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":162,"end":163,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"tetracycline","start":164,"end":176,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":177,"end":180,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"valproate","start":181,"end":190,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"treatments","start":191,"end":201,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":202,"end":204,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"therapeutic","start":205,"end":216,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"doses","start":217,"end":222,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":223,"end":224,"id":31,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":137,"end":147,"token_start":20,"token_end":20,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":150,"end":161,"token_start":22,"token_end":22,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":164,"end":176,"token_start":24,"token_end":24,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":-577789781,"_task_hash":-1654671405,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"config":{"block":[{"view_id":"relations"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\" onclick=\"contextClicked()\">Click to get full context</button><div class=\"content\" style=\"display: none;text-align:left;\">{{{paragraph}}}</div>"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"proceed()\">Proceed to choice questions</button>"}]},"answer":"ignore"}
{"text":"Comparative clinical studies show fenticonazole once or twice daily to be at least as effective as six different topical antimycotics ( miconazole , clotrimazole , econazole , bifonazole , naftifine and cyclopyroxolamine ) in the treatment of superficial mycoses of the skin .","paragraph":"Fenticonazole is an imidazole derivative with a broad spectrum of antimycotic activity against dermatophytes and yeasts in in vitro and clinical studies. Fenticonazole exerts its unique antimycotic mechanism of action in the following three ways: (i) inhibition of the secretion of protease acid by Candida albicans; (ii) damage to the cytoplasmic membrane; and (iii) by blocking cytochrome oxidases and peroxidises. Fenticonazole has also been shown to exhibit antibacterial action, with a spectrum of activity that includes bacteria commonly associated with superinfected fungal skin and vaginal infections, and antiparasitic action against the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Therefore, fenticonazole may be an ideal topical alternative to multi-agent treatment of mixed infections involving mycotic, bacterial, dermatophyte and/or Trichomonas spp.Open-label clinical studies show that fenticonazole, in different pharmaceutical preparations administered once or twice daily, is effective in the treatment of superficial mycoses of the skin. In particular, fenticonazole is very effective (often with 100% of patients achieving a negative mycological assay) in pityriasis versicolor and candidiasis. For example, a large (n = 760) study showed fenticonazole 2% cream, spray or powder to be associated with a mycological response in 100% of patients with pityriasis versicolor, 96.3% of those with tinea infections and 95.2% of patients with Candida infections.<b><i>Comparative clinical studies show fenticonazole once or twice daily to be at least as effective as six different topical antimycotics ( miconazole , clotrimazole , econazole , bifonazole , naftifine and cyclopyroxolamine ) in the treatment of superficial mycoses of the skin .</i></b> Intravaginal administration of fenticonazole is associated with a high rate of microbiological efficacy in patients with vaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis, mixed infection and bacterial vaginosis. Intravaginal fenticonazole is at least as effective as clotrimazole and shows similar efficacy to miconazole in patients with vaginal candidiasis. Fenticonazole has a rapid onset of action and clinical efficacy is generally observed within days of commencing treatment.Topical fenticonazole is very well tolerated; adverse events are generally mild to moderate in severity and transient. The most frequent adverse events are burning sensation/cutaneous irritation and itch when applied to the skin.

{"text":"Intravaginal fenticonazole is at least as effective as clotrimazole and shows similar efficacy to miconazole in patients with vaginal candidiasis .","paragraph":"Fenticonazole is an imidazole derivative with a broad spectrum of antimycotic activity against dermatophytes and yeasts in in vitro and clinical studies. Fenticonazole exerts its unique antimycotic mechanism of action in the following three ways: (i) inhibition of the secretion of protease acid by Candida albicans; (ii) damage to the cytoplasmic membrane; and (iii) by blocking cytochrome oxidases and peroxidises. Fenticonazole has also been shown to exhibit antibacterial action, with a spectrum of activity that includes bacteria commonly associated with superinfected fungal skin and vaginal infections, and antiparasitic action against the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Therefore, fenticonazole may be an ideal topical alternative to multi-agent treatment of mixed infections involving mycotic, bacterial, dermatophyte and/or Trichomonas spp.Open-label clinical studies show that fenticonazole, in different pharmaceutical preparations administered once or twice daily, is effective in the treatment of superficial mycoses of the skin. In particular, fenticonazole is very effective (often with 100% of patients achieving a negative mycological assay) in pityriasis versicolor and candidiasis. For example, a large (n = 760) study showed fenticonazole 2% cream, spray or powder to be associated with a mycological response in 100% of patients with pityriasis versicolor, 96.3% of those with tinea infections and 95.2% of patients with Candida infections. Comparative clinical studies show fenticonazole once or twice daily to be at least as effective as six different topical antimycotics (miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, bifonazole, naftifine and cyclopyroxolamine) in the treatment of superficial mycoses of the skin. Intravaginal administration of fenticonazole is associated with a high rate of microbiological efficacy in patients with vaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis, mixed infection and bacterial vaginosis.<b><i>Intravaginal fenticonazole is at least as effective as clotrimazole and shows similar efficacy to miconazole in patients with vaginal candidiasis .</i></b> Fenticonazole has a rapid onset of action and clinical efficacy is generally observed within days of commencing treatment.Topical fenticonazole is very well tolerated; adverse events are generally mild to moderate in severity and transient. The most frequent adverse events are burning sensation/cutaneous irritation and itch when applied to the skin. In a large, open-label study in superficial mycoses of the skin, the incidence of adverse events was <5% and these were rarely responsible for treatment discontinuation. Burning sensation is the most common adverse event seen with fenticonazole when administered intravaginally.

This combination has high pangenotypic antiviral potency regardless of the severity and patient characteristics.<b><i>The combination of sofosbuvir and an NS5A inhibitor with ribavirin for 12 weeks appears to be a very good further treatment option in both cirrhotic and treatment-experienced patients whatever the stage of fibrosis .</i></b> ","tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"combination","start":3,"end":14,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":15,"end":17,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"sofosbuvir","start":18,"end":28,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":29,"end":32,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":33,"end":35,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"NS5A","start":36,"end":40,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"inhibitor","start":41,"end":50,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":51,"end":55,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"ribavirin","start":56,"end":65,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"for","start":66,"end":69,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"12","start":70,"end":72,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"weeks","start":73,"end":78,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"appears","start":79,"end":86,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":87,"end":89,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":90,"end":92,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":93,"end":94,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"very","start":95,"end":99,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"good","start":100,"end":104,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"further","start":105,"end":112,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"treatment","start":113,"end":122,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"option","start":123,"end":129,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":130,"end":132,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"both","start":133,"end":137,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"cirrhotic","start":138,"end":147,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":148,"end":151,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"treatment-experienced","start":152,"end":173,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"patients","start":174,"end":182,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"whatever","start":183,"end":191,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":192,"end":195,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"stage","start":196,"end":201,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":202,"end":204,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"fibrosis","start":205,"end":213,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":214,"end":215,"id":33,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":18,"end":28,"token_start":3,"token_end":3,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":56,"end":65,"token_start":9,"token_end":9,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":-1836044337,"_task_hash":1593432948,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"config":{"block":[{"view_id":"relations"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\" onclick=\"contextClicked()\">Click to get full context</button><div class=\"content\" style=\"display: none;text-align:left;\">{{{paragraph}}}</div>"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"proceed()\">Proceed to choice questions</button>"}]},"answer":"accept"}

There were no reports of severe AEs during combination treatment, and no clinically significant changes were noted in clinical and laboratory values.<b><i>Although mild , localized psoriasis recurred in most of these patients after cyclosporine termination , no patient experienced rebound or psoriasis flare and all continued with long-term efalizumab treatment .</i></b>","tokens":[{"text":"Although","start":0,"end":8,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"mild","start":8,"end":12,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":13,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"localized","start":15,"end":24,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"psoriasis","start":25,"end":34,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"recurred","start":35,"end":43,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":44,"end":46,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"most","start":47,"end":51,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":52,"end":54,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"these","start":55,"end":60,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"patients","start":61,"end":69,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"after","start":70,"end":75,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"cyclosporine","start":76,"end":88,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"termination","start":89,"end":100,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":101,"end":102,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"no","start":103,"end":105,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"patient","start":106,"end":113,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"experienced","start":114,"end":125,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"rebound","start":126,"end":133,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":134,"end":136,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"psoriasis","start":137,"end":146,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"flare","start":147,"end":152,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":153,"end":156,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"all","start":157,"end":160,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"continued","start":161,"end":170,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":171,"end":175,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"long-term","start":176,"end":185,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"efalizumab","start":186,"end":196,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"treatment","start":197,"end":206,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":207,"end":208,"id":29,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":76,"end":88,"token_start":12,"token_end":12,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":186,"end":196,"token_start":27,"token_end":27,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":2138826653,"_task_hash":1640265304,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"config":{"block":[{"view_id":"relations"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\" onclick=\"contextClicked()\">Click to get full context</button><div class=\"content\" style=\"display: none;text-align:left;\">{{{paragraph}}}</div>"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"proceed()\">Proceed to choice questions</button>"}]},"answer":"ignore"}

However, long-term results remain relatively disappointing because of chronic allograft dysfunction and patient morbidity or mortality, which is often related to the adverse effects of immunosuppressive treatment. Thus, the induction of specific immunological tolerance of the recipient towards the allograft remains an important objective in transplantation. In this article, we first briefly describe the mechanisms of allograft rejection and immune tolerance. We then review in detail current tolerogenic strategies that could promote central or peripheral tolerance, highlighting the promises as well as the remaining challenges in clinical transplantation. The induction of haematopoietic mixed chimerism could be an approach to induce robust central tolerance, and we describe recent encouraging reports of end-stage kidney disease patients, without concomitant malignancy, who have undergone combined bone marrow and kidney transplantation.<b><i>We discuss current studies suggesting that , while promoting peripheral transplantation tolerance in preclinical models , induction protocols based on lymphocyte depletion ( polyclonal antithymocyte globulins , alemtuzumab ) or co-stimulatory blockade ( belatacept ) should , at the current stage , be considered more as drug-minimization rather than tolerance-inducing strategies .</i></b> Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms that promote peripheral tolerance has led to newer approaches and the investigation of individualized donor-specific cellular therapies based on manipulated recipient regulatory T cells.","tokens":[{"text":"We","start":0,"end":2,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"discuss","start":2,"end":9,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"current","start":10,"end":17,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"studies","start":18,"end":25,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"suggesting","start":26,"end":36,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":37,"end":41,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":42,"end":43,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"while","start":44,"end":49,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"promoting","start":50,"end":59,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"peripheral","start":60,"end":70,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"transplantation","start":71,"end":86,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"tolerance","start":87,"end":96,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":97,"end":99,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"preclinical","start":100,"end":111,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"models","start":112,"end":118,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":119,"end":120,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"induction","start":121,"end":130,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"protocols","start":131,"end":140,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"based","start":141,"end":146,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":147,"end":149,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"lymphocyte","start":150,"end":160,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"depletion","start":161,"end":170,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":171,"end":172,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"polyclonal","start":173,"end":183,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"antithymocyte","start":184,"end":197,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"globulins","start":198,"end":207,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":208,"end":209,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"alemtuzumab","start":210,"end":221,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":222,"end":223,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":224,"end":226,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"co-stimulatory","start":227,"end":241,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"blockade","start":242,"end":250,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":251,"end":252,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"belatacept","start":253,"end":263,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":264,"end":265,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"should","start":266,"end":272,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":273,"end":274,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"at","start":275,"end":277,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":278,"end":281,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"current","start":282,"end":289,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"stage","start":290,"end":295,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":296,"end":297,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"be","start":298,"end":300,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"considered","start":301,"end":311,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"more","start":312,"end":316,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"as","start":317,"end":319,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":"drug-minimization","start":320,"end":337,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"rather","start":338,"end":344,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":"than","start":345,"end":349,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":"tolerance-inducing","start":350,"end":368,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"strategies","start":369,"end":379,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":380,"end":381,"id":51,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":210,"end":221,"token_start":27,"token_end":27,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":253,"end":263,"token_start":33,"token_end":33,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":722266454,"_task_hash":-875245812,"_session_id":"drug_drug-aryeht","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"answer":"accept"}

In the present study, we assessed the anti-cancer activity of auranofin and its effect on the thioredoxin (Trx) system under conditions that closely resemble the in vivo tumor microenvironment with respect to the oxygen levels and tissue architecture. We utilised an oxygen scheme involving growth of cancer cells under normoxia (20%) and hypoxia (0.1%). We also preconditioned cells with intermittent hypoxia (IH) prior to a prolonged hypoxic incubation. This oxygen scheme did not affect the cytotoxicity of auranofin; however, IH preconditioned cells were less sensitive towards the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) specific activity upon treatment with auranofin. IH preconditioning also upregulated Trx protein levels in auranofin treated cells. We also compared the activity of auranofin against cancer cells cultured in 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid-based culture models. Auranofin was less potent against cells grown under a more in vivo-like 3D environment.

We thus demonstrated for the first time that the use of an autophagy inhibitor can overcome resistance to the combination of MTOR and AKT inhibitors in MCL cell lines and primary samples, demonstrating the prosurvival role of autophagy in AKT-MTOR compromised cells, and pointing out some potential opportunities using this triple combinational strategy in hematological malignancies.","tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"mechanistic","start":3,"end":14,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"target","start":15,"end":21,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":22,"end":24,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"rapamycin","start":25,"end":34,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":35,"end":36,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"MTOR","start":37,"end":41,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":42,"end":43,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"kinase","start":44,"end":50,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"inhibitor","start":51,"end":60,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"everolimus","start":61,"end":71,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":72,"end":73,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"RAD001","start":74,"end":80,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":81,"end":82,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"has","start":83,"end":86,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"shown","start":87,"end":92,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"activity","start":93,"end":101,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":102,"end":104,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"preclinical","start":105,"end":116,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":117,"end":120,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"clinical","start":121,"end":129,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"models","start":130,"end":136,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":137,"end":139,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"MCL","start":140,"end":143,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":144,"end":145,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"despite","start":146,"end":153,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":154,"end":157,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"fact","start":158,"end":162,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"that","start":163,"end":167,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"its","start":168,"end":171,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"mechanism","start":172,"end":181,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":182,"end":184,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"action","start":185,"end":191,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"has","start":192,"end":195,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"not","start":196,"end":199,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"been","start":200,"end":204,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"fully","start":205,"end":210,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"elucidated","start":211,"end":221,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":222,"end":223,"id":38,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":25,"end":34,"token_start":4,"token_end":4,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":61,"end":71,"token_start":10,"token_end":10,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":-1773461026,"_task_hash":1310682897,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"config":{"block":[{"view_id":"relations"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" class=\"collapsible\" onclick=\"contextClicked()\">Click to get full context</button><div class=\"content\" style=\"display: none;text-align:left;\">{{{paragraph}}}</div>"},{"view_id":"html","html_template":"<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"proceed()\">Proceed to choice questions</button>"}]},"answer":"accept"}

The Fe cluster in MIL-88B(Fe) seems to have the highest affinity for the carboxylic group of pharmaceuticals compared with Al and Zr; however, the lower porosity of MIL-88B(Fe) might limit the adsorption capacity. Moreover, in mixed solutions, the higher acidity of mefenamic acid can enhance competitive performance in interactions with the metal cation cluster of each MOF. Together with the breathing effect, H-bonding and \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction were shown to be the alternative interactions of synergetic adsorption mechanisms.","tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"synergetic","start":3,"end":13,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"effects","start":14,"end":21,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":22,"end":24,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic","start":25,"end":49,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"acid","start":50,"end":54,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":55,"end":56,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"BDC","start":57,"end":60,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":61,"end":62,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"linker","start":63,"end":69,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"structure","start":70,"end":79,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":80,"end":83,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":84,"end":87,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"metal","start":88,"end":93,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"cluster","start":94,"end":101,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":102,"end":104,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"MOFs","start":105,"end":109,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":110,"end":112,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"adsorption","start":113,"end":123,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"mechanisms","start":124,"end":134,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":135,"end":137,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"carbamazepine","start":138,"end":151,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":152,"end":153,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"ciprofloxacin","start":154,"end":167,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":168,"end":171,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"mefenamic","start":172,"end":181,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"acid","start":182,"end":186,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"were","start":187,"end":191,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"investigated","start":192,"end":204,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":205,"end":207,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"single","start":208,"end":214,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":215,"end":218,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"mixed","start":219,"end":224,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"solutions","start":225,"end":234,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":235,"end":236,"id":34,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":25,"end":49,"token_start":4,"token_end":4,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":105,"end":109,"token_start":16,"token_end":16,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":138,"end":151,"token_start":21,"token_end":21,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":154,"end":167,"token_start":23,"token_end":23,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":172,"end":181,"token_start":25,"token_end":25,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":1699742200,"_task_hash":703190866,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[{"head":4,"child":16,"head_span":{"start":25,"end":49,"token_start":4,"token_end":4,"label":"DRUG"},"child_span":{"start":105,"end":109,"token_start":16,"token_end":16,"label":"DRUG"},"color":"#c5bdf4","label":"SYN1"},{"head":4,"child":21,"head_span":{"start":25,"end":49,"token_start":4,"token_end":4,"label":"DRUG"},"child_span":{"start":138,"end":151,"token_start":21,"token_end":21,"label":"DRUG"},"color":"#ffd882","label":"SYN2"},{"head":4,"child":23,"head_span":{"start":25,"end":49,"token_start":4,"token_end":4,"label":"DRUG"},"child_span":{"start":154,"end":167,"token_start":23,"token_end":23,"label":"DRUG"},"color":"#d9fbad","label":"SYN3"}],"answer":"accept","radio":["SYN10","SYN1T0","SYN20","SYN2T0","SYN30","SYN3T0"]}

In stage II regional radiotherapy was followed, after randomization, by transdiaphragmatic irradiation, all patients received maintenance chemotherapy. The group was too small to draw conclusions about the effect of this treatment. Primary radiotherapy in stage II disease with diffuse histology gave bad results. Patients in stage III and IV were treated with 8 courses of chemotherapy with Adriamycin, VM26, Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone, given in two different time schedules. Iceberg radiation was then given to areas with initially large or slowly responding disease. All patients had maintenance chemotherapy. No difference was found for the 2 chemotherapy schedules in remission rate, disease free interval and survival. In stage III and IV patients with a follicular lymphoma have a longer relapse free interval and total survival (39% and 68% at 5 years) compared with those with a lymphoma diffuse histology (19 and 30% at 5 years).

Antiandrogens could also contribute to the feminisation of male fish, but there are far less data supporting this hypothesis and almost nothing is known for the effects of oestrogens in combination with antiandrogens in fish.<b><i>We conducted a series of in vivo exposures in two fish species to investigate the potency on reproductive-relevant endpoints of the antiandrogenic antimicrobials triclosan ( TCS ) , chlorophene ( CP ) and dichlorophene ( DCP ) and the resin , abietic acid ( AbA ) , all found widely in WwTW effluents .</i></b> We also undertook exposures with a mixture of antiandrogens and a mixture of antiandrogens in combination with the oestrogen 17\u03b1-ethinyloestradiol (EE2). In stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), DCP showed a tendency to reduce spiggin induction in females androgenised by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), but these findings were not conclusive. In roach (Rutilus rutilus), exposures to DCP (178 days), or a mixture of TCS, CP and AbA (185 days), or to the model antiandrogen flutamide (FL, 178 days) had no effect on gonadal sex ratio or on the development of the reproductive ducts. Exposure to EE2 (1.5ng/L, 185 days) induced feminisation of the ducts in 17% of the males and in the mixture of antiandrogens (TCS, CP, AbA) in combination with EE2, almost all (96%) of the males had a feminised reproductive ducts. In stickleback androgen receptor (AR\u03b1 and AR\u03b2) transactivation assays, the model antiandrogens, FL and procymidone inhibited 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) induced receptor activation, but none of the human antiandrogens, TCS, CP, DCP and AbA had an effect. These data indicate that antimicrobial antiandrogens in combination can contribute to the feminisation process in exposed males, but they do not appear to act through the androgen receptor in fish.

Considering this information and in an effort to search other options for neurocysticercosis treatment, the present study was designed to assess the in vitro and in vivo activity of the PZQ-MBZ combination against Taenia crassiceps metacestodes. For the in vitro studies T. crassiceps cysticerci (ORF strain) were used and the analysis of the combinations was performed using the Surface of Synergistic Interaction (SSI). For the in vivo evaluation the experimental infection model of T. crassiceps ORF in Balb-C mice was used. In vitro results showed that the combination of PZQ 121.6\u202fnM-MBZ 5.1\u202fnM exhibited the highest synergic cysticidal effect. In vivo, the PZQ-MBZ combination (25\u202fmg/kg - 50\u202fmg/kg, respectively) was more effective than each drug alone. The findings indicate that PZQ in combination with MBZ could be a promising alternative for the treatment of neurocysticercosis. Complementary studies are required to confirm its clinical applicability.","tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"current","start":3,"end":10,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"pharmacological","start":11,"end":26,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"treatment","start":27,"end":36,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":37,"end":39,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"neurocysticercosis","start":40,"end":58,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"is","start":59,"end":61,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"based","start":62,"end":67,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":68,"end":70,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"two","start":71,"end":74,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"drugs","start":75,"end":80,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":81,"end":82,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"praziquantel","start":83,"end":95,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":96,"end":97,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"PZQ","start":98,"end":101,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":102,"end":103,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":104,"end":107,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"albendazole","start":108,"end":119,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":";","start":120,"end":121,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"however","start":122,"end":129,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":130,"end":131,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"suboptimal","start":132,"end":142,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"efficacy","start":143,"end":151,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"has","start":152,"end":155,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"been","start":156,"end":160,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"documented","start":161,"end":171,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":172,"end":173,"id":26,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":83,"end":95,"token_start":12,"token_end":12,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":108,"end":119,"token_start":17,"token_end":17,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":424792123,"_task_hash":1319569917,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"answer":"ignore"}

At 2 years, 26 and 25 patients in groups I and II, respectively, were analyzed in an on-therapy and an ITT analysis. In the on-therapy analysis, group II showed lower serum creatinine (1.3+/-0.2 vs. 1.6+/-0.6 mg/dL) and lower diastolic blood pressure (74+/-9 vs. 80+/-11 mm Hg). No acute rejections occurred during the second year of follow-up. In more than 90% of patients, proteinuria was less than 1 g/d, and in 50% it was negative. In the ITT analysis, differences were found only in diastolic blood pressure (80+/-10 vs. 74+/-8 mm Hg in groups I and II respectively, P=0.009). Tacrolimus withdrawal from a combination of sirolimus and tacrolimus, in selected patients, may be observed at 2 years by an improvement in renal function and blood pressure without a higher incidence of proteinuria.","tokens":[{"text":"Improved","start":0,"end":8,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"renal","start":8,"end":13,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"function","start":14,"end":22,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":23,"end":24,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":25,"end":29,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"similar","start":30,"end":37,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"proteinuria","start":38,"end":49,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":50,"end":51,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"after","start":52,"end":57,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"two","start":58,"end":61,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"years","start":62,"end":67,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":68,"end":70,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"early","start":71,"end":76,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"tacrolimus","start":77,"end":87,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"withdrawal","start":88,"end":98,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"from","start":99,"end":103,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":104,"end":105,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"regimen","start":106,"end":113,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":114,"end":116,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"sirolimus","start":117,"end":126,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"plus","start":127,"end":131,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"tacrolimus","start":132,"end":142,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":143,"end":144,"id":22,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":77,"end":87,"token_start":13,"token_end":13,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":117,"end":126,"token_start":19,"token_end":19,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":132,"end":142,"token_start":21,"token_end":21,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":1048211821,"_task_hash":1866610103,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[{"head":19,"child":21,"head_span":{"start":117,"end":126,"token_start":19,"token_end":19,"label":"DRUG"},"child_span":{"start":132,"end":142,"token_start":21,"token_end":21,"label":"DRUG"},"color":"#c5bdf4","label":"SYN1"}],"radio":["SYN10","SYN1T0"],"answer":"accept"}

{"text":"Based on the findings of this review the following recommendations can be made with regard to tocolysis with calcium channel blockers : firstly , calcium channel blockers should not be combined with intravenous beta-agonists ; secondly , intravenous nicardipine or high oral doses of nifedipine should not be used in cases where the mother is cardiovascular compromised or in cases of multiple gestation ; finally , blood pressure should be monitored and cardiotocography recorded during the administration of immediate release tablets and patients should be advised to avoid chewing them .","paragraph":"<h3><u>Calcium channel blockers for tocolysis: a review of their role and safety following reports of serious adverse events.</u></h3>The use of <b style='color:Tomato;'><i>nifedipine</i></b> and other calcium channel blockers has become commonplace in the management of preterm labour. Several relatively small randomised trials have compared calcium channel blockers with beta-agonists and the meta-analyses of these studies have demonstrated superior or comparable efficacy and a superior adverse events profile. The safety of calcium channel blockers in pregnancy has not been rigorously evaluated and they remain unlicensed for use as tocolytics. Indeed, there is concern following a number of recent case studies that have reported serious adverse events after the administration of a calcium channel blocker as a tocolytic. In this article all these recently reported cases are critically reviewed and the pros and cons of tocolytic treatment options are discussed. <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>Based</i></b> <b

Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of Beclin1 or ATG5, significantly reduced killing. The drugs synergized to elevate ROS production; activation of ATM was ROS-dependent. ATM activation was required for enhanced phosphorylation of \u03b3H2AX, eIF2\u03b1 and ATG13 S318. The drug combination reduced histone deacetylase protein expression which required autophagy.

The drugs inactivated mTORC1 and mTORC2 and interacted to further increase the phosphorylation of ATM, ATG13 and eIF2\u03b1. Elevated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was responsible for reduced MCL-1 and BCL-XL expression and for increased Beclin1 and ATG5 expression. Over-expression of BCL-XL or knock down of Beclin1 or ATG5, significantly reduced killing. The drugs synergized to elevate ROS production; activation of ATM was ROS-dependent. ATM activation was required for enhanced phosphorylation of \u03b3H2AX, eIF2\u03b1 and ATG13 S318. The drug combination reduced histone deacetylase protein expression which required autophagy.

A single dose of RSV 500\u2009mg was administered once daily for 10\u2009days during treatment phase. A single dose of CBZ 200\u2009mg was administered during control and after treatment phases under fasting conditions. The blood samples were collected after CBZ dosing at predetermined time intervals and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In comparison with the control, RSV pretreatment significantly enhanced maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ), area under the curve (AUC), and half life (t1/2 ) and significantly decreased apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F), while there was no significant change observed in time to reach maximum concentration (tmax ) and elimination rate constant (kel ) of CBZ. Furthermore, RSV pretreatment significantly decreased metabolite to parent (CBZE/CBZ) ratios of Cmax and AUC and significantly increased CBZE/CBZ ratios of CL/F and Vd/F, indicating the reduced formation of CBZE to CBZ. The results suggest that the altered CYP3A4 enzyme activity and pharmacokinetics of CBZ might be attributed to RSV-mediated inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme. Thus, there is a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between RSV and CBZ including other CYP3A4 substrates.","tokens":[{"text":"The","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"purpose","start":3,"end":10,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":11,"end":13,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":14,"end":17,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"present","start":18,"end":25,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"study","start":26,"end":31,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"was","start":32,"end":35,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":36,"end":38,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"assess","start":39,"end":45,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":46,"end":49,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"effect","start":50,"end":56,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":57,"end":59,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"resveratrol","start":60,"end":71,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":72,"end":73,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"RSV","start":74,"end":77,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":78,"end":79,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"pretreatment","start":80,"end":92,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":93,"end":95,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"CYP3A4","start":96,"end":102,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"enzyme","start":103,"end":109,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"activity","start":110,"end":118,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":119,"end":122,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"pharmacokinetics","start":123,"end":139,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":140,"end":142,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"carbamazepine","start":143,"end":156,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":157,"end":158,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"CBZ","start":159,"end":162,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":163,"end":164,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":165,"end":167,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"healthy","start":168,"end":175,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"human","start":176,"end":181,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"volunteers","start":182,"end":192,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":193,"end":194,"id":32,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":60,"end":71,"token_start":12,"token_end":12,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":143,"end":156,"token_start":24,"token_end":24,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":51602931,"_task_hash":1061515609,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[{"head":12,"child":24,"head_span":{"start":60,"end":71,"token_start":12,"token_end":12,"label":"DRUG"},"child_span":{"start":143,"end":156,"token_start":24,"token_end":24,"label":"DRUG"},"color":"#96e8ce","label":"COMB1"}],"radio":["COMB11","COMB1T0"],"answer":"accept"}

Reperfusion is the return of blood flow to the ischemic bowel. Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species, local inflammatory response, and may lead to the patient's death. Pre-treatment of the intestinal may reduce the high mortality associated with AMI. 5-Hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B) and 5-HT1D receptors have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in different experimental studies. We aimed to investigate the potential involvement of these receptors in intestinal I/R injury. Firstly, we assessed the expression and localization of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in the enteric nervous system using an immunofluorescence-based method. Intestinal I/R in rats was induced by 30\u00a0min occlusion of superior mesenteric artery and reperfusion for 2\u00a0h.

The open-label, two period, sequential study was conducted in 12 healthy human volunteers. A single dose of RSV 500\u2009mg was administered once daily for 10\u2009days during treatment phase. A single dose of CBZ 200\u2009mg was administered during control and after treatment phases under fasting conditions. The blood samples were collected after CBZ dosing at predetermined time intervals and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In comparison with the control, RSV pretreatment significantly enhanced maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ), area under the curve (AUC), and half life (t1/2 ) and significantly decreased apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F), while there was no significant change observed in time to reach maximum concentration (tmax ) and elimination rate constant (kel ) of CBZ. Furthermore, RSV pretreatment significantly decreased metabolite to parent (CBZE/CBZ) ratios of Cmax and AUC and significantly increased CBZE/CBZ ratios of CL/F and Vd/F, indicating the reduced formation of CBZE to CBZ. The results suggest that the altered CYP3A4 enzyme activity and pharmacokinetics of CBZ might be attributed to RSV-mediated inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme. Thus, there is a potential pharmacokinetic interaction between RSV and CBZ including other CYP3A4 substrates.","tokens":[{"text":"Effect","start":0,"end":6,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":6,"end":8,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"resveratrol","start":9,"end":20,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":21,"end":23,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":24,"end":27,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"pharmacokinetics","start":28,"end":44,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"of","start":45,"end":47,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"carbamazepine","start":48,"end":61,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"in","start":62,"end":64,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"healthy","start":65,"end":72,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"human","start":73,"end":78,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"volunteers","start":79,"end":89,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":90,"end":91,"id":12,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":9,"end":20,"token_start":2,"token_end":2,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":48,"end":61,"token_start":7,"token_end":7,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":661016520,"_task_hash":-1932400469,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[{"head":2,"child":7,"head_span":{"start":9,"end":20,"token_start":2,"token_end":2,"label":"DRUG"},"child_span":{"start":48,"end":61,"token_start":7,"token_end":7,"label":"DRUG"},"color":"#96e8ce","label":"COMB1"}],"radio":["POS10","POS1T0","COMB10","COMB1T0"],"answer":"accept"}

Ovaries were scanned by ultrasound on Days-9, -2, 0, 1 (day of ovulation) and 3 times a week thereafter until a subsequent ovulation. From Days 0 to 15, the rate of increase of plasma progesterone (P4) was greater (P < 0.01) for Deslorelin than for control and Buserelin. Establishment of the first-wave dominant follicle (FWDF) as a Class 3 (> 9 mm) follicle was delayed (P < 0.01) with Deslorelin (14.2 +/- 1.3 d) compared with the control (4.6 +/- 1.3 d) and Buserelin (5.0 +/- 1.5 d) treatments. The FWDF resumed growth after Day 13 in all 5 Deslorelin-treated cows, and 2 cows ovulated spontaneously. In 1 Deslorelin-treated cow, the FWDF regressed, and a second-wave dominant follicle ovulated, while 2 other Deslorelin cows failed to ovulate until after Day 36. The cumulative numbers of Class 2 and 3 follicles was lowest in the Deslorelin group (P < 0.01), while the cumulative number of Class 1 follicles was highest (Deslorelin > Buserelin > Control; P < 0.01). The number of days to CL-regression and days to subsequent estrus did not differ (P > 0.05) among treatments. In Experiment II, 16 lactating potentially subfertile (body condition score 2.25) cows received Cystorelin (100 micrograms, i.m.; Day-9), Lutalyse (25 mg, i.m.; Day-2), and either a Cystorelin injection (100 micrograms, i.m.; n = 8) or Deslorelin implant (700 micrograms, s.c.; n = 8) on Day 0 and inseminated 16 h later. Deslorelin-treated cows had a higher plasma P4 concentration between Days 0 and 16 (P < 0.05) than the 2 other groups, and 5 of the 8 cows in this group were pregnant (Day 45, palpation) compared with 1 of 8 cows in the Cystorelin group (P < 0.05). Incorporation of a Deslorelin implant into a timed-insemination protocol enhanced the pregnancy rate in cows of poor body condition. The results support the hypothesis that enhanced CL function and delayed establishment of the first-wave dominant follicle may enhance embryo survival.","tokens":[{"text":"In","start":0,"end":2,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"Experiment","start":2,"end":12,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"1","start":13,"end":14,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":15,"end":16,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"15","start":17,"end":19,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"non","start":20,"end":23,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"lactating","start":24,"end":33,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"cyclic","start":34,"end":40,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"Holstein","start":41,"end":49,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"cows","start":50,"end":54,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"received","start":55,"end":63,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"Buserelin","start":64,"end":73,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":74,"end":75,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"8","start":76,"end":77,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"micrograms","start":78,"end":88,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":89,"end":90,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"i.m","start":91,"end":94,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":95,"end":96,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":97,"end":98,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":99,"end":101,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"Day-9","start":102,"end":107,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":108,"end":109,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"Lutalyse","start":110,"end":118,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":119,"end":120,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"25","start":121,"end":123,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"mg","start":124,"end":126,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":127,"end":128,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"i.m","start":129,"end":132,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":133,"end":134,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":135,"end":136,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":137,"end":139,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"Day-2","start":140,"end":145,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":146,"end":147,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":148,"end":151,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"then","start":152,"end":156,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"on","start":157,"end":159,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"Day","start":160,"end":163,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":"0","start":164,"end":165,"id":37,"ws":true},{"text":"received","start":166,"end":174,"id":38,"ws":true},{"text":"either","start":175,"end":181,"id":39,"ws":true},{"text":"a","start":182,"end":183,"id":40,"ws":true},{"text":"Deslorelin","start":184,"end":194,"id":41,"ws":true},{"text":"implant","start":195,"end":202,"id":42,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":203,"end":204,"id":43,"ws":true},{"text":"700","start":205,"end":208,"id":44,"ws":true},{"text":"micrograms","start":209,"end":219,"id":45,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":220,"end":221,"id":46,"ws":true},{"text":"s.c","start":222,"end":225,"id":47,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":226,"end":227,"id":48,"ws":true},{"text":";","start":228,"end":229,"id":49,"ws":true},{"text":"n","start":230,"end":231,"id":50,"ws":true},{"text":"=","start":232,"end":233,"id":51,"ws":true},{"text":"5","start":234,"end":235,"id":52,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":236,"end":237,"id":53,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":238,"end":239,"id":54,"ws":true},{"text":"Buserelin","start":240,"end":249,"id":55,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":250,"end":251,"id":56,"ws":true},{"text":"8","start":252,"end":253,"id":57,"ws":true},{"text":"micrograms","start":254,"end":264,"id":58,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":265,"end":266,"id":59,"ws":true},{"text":"i.m","start":267,"end":270,"id":60,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":271,"end":272,"id":61,"ws":true},{"text":";","start":273,"end":274,"id":62,"ws":true},{"text":"n","start":275,"end":276,"id":63,"ws":true},{"text":"=","start":277,"end":278,"id":64,"ws":true},{"text":"5","start":279,"end":280,"id":65,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":281,"end":282,"id":66,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":283,"end":284,"id":67,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":285,"end":287,"id":68,"ws":true},{"text":"no","start":288,"end":290,"id":69,"ws":true},{"text":"treatment","start":291,"end":300,"id":70,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":301,"end":302,"id":71,"ws":true},{"text":"control","start":303,"end":310,"id":72,"ws":true},{"text":";","start":311,"end":312,"id":73,"ws":true},{"text":"n","start":313,"end":314,"id":74,"ws":true},{"text":"=","start":315,"end":316,"id":75,"ws":true},{"text":"5","start":317,"end":318,"id":76,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":319,"end":320,"id":77,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":321,"end":322,"id":78,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":64,"end":73,"token_start":11,"token_end":11,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":184,"end":194,"token_start":41,"token_end":41,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":240,"end":249,"token_start":55,"token_end":55,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":1946101462,"_task_hash":373568303,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"answer":"ignore"}

BRD2 and BRD4, members of the BET family, are significantly increased in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary adult brain cancer. OTX015 (MK-8628), a novel BRD2/3/4 inhibitor, is under evaluation in dose-finding studies in solid tumors, including GBM. We investigated the pharmacologic characteristics of OTX015 as a single agent and combined with targeted therapy or conventional chemotherapies in glioblastoma cell lines. OTX015 displayed higher antiproliferative effects compared to its analog JQ1, with GI50 values of approximately 0.2 \u00b5M. In addition, C-MYC and CDKN1A mRNA levels increased transiently after 4 h-exposure to OTX015, while BRD2, SESN3, HEXIM-1, HIST2H2BE, and HIST1H2BK were rapidly upregulated and sustained after 24 h.

Similar results were obtained for diastolic, for daytime blood pressure, and for nighttime blood pressure. Treatment was well tolerated in all conditions. Our study demonstrates that (1) 24-hour blood pressure increases significantly during acute high-altitude exposure in hypertensive subjects and (2) treatment with angiotensin receptor blocker-calcium channel blocker combination is effective and safe in this condition.","tokens":[{"text":"One","start":0,"end":3,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"hundred","start":3,"end":10,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"untreated","start":11,"end":20,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"subjects","start":21,"end":29,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"with","start":30,"end":34,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":"mild","start":35,"end":39,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"hypertension","start":40,"end":52,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":"(","start":53,"end":54,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"screening","start":55,"end":64,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"blood","start":65,"end":70,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"pressure","start":71,"end":79,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":80,"end":81,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"144.1\u00b19.8","start":82,"end":91,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":"mm","start":92,"end":94,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"Hg","start":95,"end":97,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"systolic","start":98,"end":106,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":107,"end":108,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"92.0\u00b17.5","start":109,"end":117,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":"mm","start":118,"end":120,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"Hg","start":121,"end":123,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"diastolic","start":124,"end":133,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":")","start":134,"end":135,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":"were","start":136,"end":140,"id":22,"ws":true},{"text":"randomized","start":141,"end":151,"id":23,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":152,"end":154,"id":24,"ws":true},{"text":"double-blind","start":155,"end":167,"id":25,"ws":true},{"text":"placebo","start":168,"end":175,"id":26,"ws":true},{"text":"or","start":176,"end":178,"id":27,"ws":true},{"text":"to","start":179,"end":181,"id":28,"ws":true},{"text":"telmisartan","start":182,"end":193,"id":29,"ws":true},{"text":"80","start":194,"end":196,"id":30,"ws":true},{"text":"mg+modified","start":197,"end":208,"id":31,"ws":true},{"text":"release","start":209,"end":216,"id":32,"ws":true},{"text":"nifedipine","start":217,"end":227,"id":33,"ws":true},{"text":"30","start":228,"end":230,"id":34,"ws":true},{"text":"mg","start":231,"end":233,"id":35,"ws":true},{"text":"combination","start":234,"end":245,"id":36,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":246,"end":247,"id":37,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":182,"end":193,"token_start":29,"token_end":29,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":217,"end":227,"token_start":33,"token_end":33,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":-693018053,"_task_hash":1313519176,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[{"head":29,"child":32,"head_span":{"start":182,"end":193,"token_start":29,"token_end":29,"label":"DRUG"},"child_span":{"start":209,"end":216,"token_start":32,"token_end":32,"label":null},"color":"#c5bdf4","label":"POS1"}],"radio":["POS11","POS1T0"],"answer":"accept"}

Fortunately, the prognosis of neovascular AMD has improved dramatically since anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents reached the market 15 years ago. In large-scale clinical trials, anti-VEGF utilization maintained visual acuity in more than 90% of patients. However, providing anti-VEGF treatment requires the specialized expertise of retina specialists and is labor intensive and costly. Further, results in clinical practice do not always measure up to those obtained in rigorous phase 3 trials. Undertreatment and the burden on patients and caregivers from frequent anti-VEGF injections contribute to suboptimal visual acuity results in the real world. As a consequence, retinal specialists are focused on finding effective strategies to extend the dosing interval. These include individualized optical coherence tomography-guided dosing regimens, longer acting new agents with similar or new mechanisms of action, and sustained release delivery devices. With the recent approval of <b style='color:Tomato;'><i>brolucizumab</i></b>, the neovascular AMD armamentarium has expanded to 4 anti-VEGF agents, and more are in development. Understanding the treatment landscape is a key issue in managed care due to the substantial cost of anti-VEGF medications. The goal of this article is to provide managed care clinicians with an up-to-date assessment of currently available agents, followed by a preview of some investigational agents that could alter the future treatment landscape. <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>These</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>agents</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>include</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>abicipar</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>pegol</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>,</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>faricimab</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>,</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>the</i></b> <b style='color:MediumOrchid;'><i>ranibizumab</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>port</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>delivery</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>system</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>,</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>an</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>intravitreal</i></b> <b style='color:MediumOrchid;'><i>bevacizumab</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>formulation</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>,</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>and</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>anti-VEGF</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>biosimilars</i></b> <b style='color:DodgerBlue;'><i>.</i></b>","tokens":[{"text":"These","start":0,"end":5,"id":0,"ws":true},{"text":"agents","start":5,"end":11,"id":1,"ws":true},{"text":"include","start":12,"end":19,"id":2,"ws":true},{"text":"abicipar","start":20,"end":28,"id":3,"ws":true},{"text":"pegol","start":29,"end":34,"id":4,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":35,"end":36,"id":5,"ws":true},{"text":"faricimab","start":37,"end":46,"id":6,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":47,"end":48,"id":7,"ws":true},{"text":"the","start":49,"end":52,"id":8,"ws":true},{"text":"ranibizumab","start":53,"end":64,"id":9,"ws":true},{"text":"port","start":65,"end":69,"id":10,"ws":true},{"text":"delivery","start":70,"end":78,"id":11,"ws":true},{"text":"system","start":79,"end":85,"id":12,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":86,"end":87,"id":13,"ws":true},{"text":"an","start":88,"end":90,"id":14,"ws":true},{"text":"intravitreal","start":91,"end":103,"id":15,"ws":true},{"text":"bevacizumab","start":104,"end":115,"id":16,"ws":true},{"text":"formulation","start":116,"end":127,"id":17,"ws":true},{"text":",","start":128,"end":129,"id":18,"ws":true},{"text":"and","start":130,"end":133,"id":19,"ws":true},{"text":"anti-VEGF","start":134,"end":143,"id":20,"ws":true},{"text":"biosimilars","start":144,"end":155,"id":21,"ws":true},{"text":".","start":156,"end":157,"id":22,"ws":false}],"spans":[{"start":53,"end":64,"token_start":9,"token_end":9,"label":"DRUG"},{"start":104,"end":115,"token_start":16,"token_end":16,"label":"DRUG"}],"_input_hash":1031582397,"_task_hash":315401637,"_session_id":"drug_drug-yosis","_view_id":"blocks","relations":[],"radio":[],"answer":"accept"}
