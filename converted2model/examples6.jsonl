The intracellular activity of streptomycin, gentamicin, and netilmicin on Escherichia coli phagocytosed by murine peritoneal macrophages was studied using a sensitive and standardized method. Intracellular activity of streptomycin and gentamicin at therapeutic concentrations was seen after 1 h of incubation of antibiotics with macrophages containing phagocytosed bacteria, whilst for netilmicin a significant intracellular activity was observed only after 3 h exposure. The activity of these antibiotics against intraphagocytic bacteria was significantly lower than that observed against extracellular bacteria. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of streptomycin were active against intracellular E. coli. streptomycin was also active for a phagocytosed streptomycin-resistant strain of E. coli, but this activity was eliminated when the O2-dependent killing mechanisms of macrophages were inhibited by sodium fluoride. The data demonstrate that aminoglycosides may exert a dose-dependent intraphagocytic activity against E. coli that correlates with the time of incubation of the antibiotics with infected macrophages. Streptomycin appears to be the most effective agent followed by gentamicin and the least active was netilmicin .

We have previously shown that morning administration of dexamethasone in combination with food induces a doubling of serum leptin levels starting at 7 hours after dexamethasone administration, with a maximum effect at 10 hours, the latest time point that we have studied. However, dexamethasone given in the absence of food had no effect on serum leptin at 10 hours. The present experiment was undertaken to determine the duration of the effect of dexamethasone on 24-hour serum leptin under fasted and fed conditions in humans. ### Research Methods And Procedures Six healthy non-obese male volunteers were studied under the following four conditions: 1) dexamethasone (2 mg intravenously, given at 0900 hours) with fasting; 2) dexamethasone with food (1,700 kcal, 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30% fat, given in one meal 2 hours after dexamethasone administration at 1100 hours); 3) saline with food (same meal); 4) saline with fasting. Serum leptin, glucose, insulin, and cortisol were monitored every 30 minutes for 24 hours. ### results 1) Under the fasting condition, dexamethasone increased leptin nocturnal secretion between 2100 and 2400 hours. 2) A single meal (1,700 kcal) at 1100 hours increased nocturnal leptin secretion when compared with the fasting condition. The peak increase of leptin was 123% over baseline between 2100 and 2400 hours, 10 to 14 hours after the meal. 3) In the fed + dexamethasone condition, leptin levels increased from baseline starting 8 hours after dexamethasone injection, reached a maximum increase of 260% between 2100 and 2400 hours, then decreased thereafter, remaining elevated compared to baseline for 16 hours. There was a correlation between 24-hour leptin secretion and insulin secretion after a single morning meal. ### discussion A single bolus of dexamethasone , given before a single large meal , produces a delayed ( 6-hour ) but long-lasting increase in serum leptin ( over 16 hours ) .

Intention-to-treat analysis of 20 included patients showed eradication of bacteremia in 7 out of 9 treated patients versus 2 out of 11 untreated controls (P = 0.01). In the per-protocol analysis, eradication was obtained for 7 out of 7 treated patients versus 2 out of 9 untreated controls (P = 0.003). This study demonstrates the efficiency of the combination of doxycycline and gentamicin in eradicating B. quintana bacteremia.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12821469/"}

Systemic treatment with physostigmine , an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase , modestly reduced the acquisition and rate of heroin self-administration , and this suppression of heroin intake was reversed by pretreatment with scopolamine but not by mecamylamine . Following 10-14 days of self-administration, rats were left in the home environment for 14 days. Subsequently, rats were evaluated for extinction of nose-pokes during the first hour after being returned to the self-administration apparatus. One hour later a conditioned stimulus (house light, light in the nose-poke hole, sound of the infusion pump) was presented to initiate cue-induced reinstatement. Physostigmine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of cue-induced reinstatement, but only the dose of 0.5 mg/kg significantly decreased nose-poke responding in the extinction test. Chronic treatment with physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) did not impair performance during acquisition of heroin self-administration. However, during a subsequent reinstatement test conducted in the absence of physostigmine pretreatment, heroin seeking was significantly below that of rats chronically pretreated with saline. To evaluate brain regions mediating the effects of systemic drug treatment on reinstatement, physostigmine was microinjected into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or ventral tegmental area (VTA). Microinjection of physostigmine into the NAc prior to presenting conditioned cues inhibited the reinstatement of heroin-seeking, without affecting extinction responding. In contrast, microinjection of physostigmine into the VTA augmented the reinstatement induced by conditioned cues and extinction responding. Inactivation of either NAc or VTA by microinjecting tetrodotoxin blocked both extinction responding and cue-induced reinstatement. These data demonstrate that cholinergic transmission influences heroin self-administration and reinstatement. Moreover, cue-induced reinstatement was inhibited by physostigmine in the NAc and potentiated by cholinergic stimulation in the VTA.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17184925/"}

Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) commonly occurs in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with PVTT usually have an aggressive disease course, decreased liver function reserve, limited treatment options, higher recurrence rates after treatment, and, therefore, worse overall survival. Among untreated HCC patients with PVTT, the median overall survival has been reported as low as 2 to 4 months. Historically, many aspects of PVTT have impacted the theoretical and practical safety and efficacy of treatment, for example, disordered blood flow and associated impairment of liver function, heat-sink effects of blood flow in the area of the PVTT, and risk of recurrence due to tumor location in the blood vessel. The current Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system categorizes HCC patients with PVTT as advanced stage, for which the standard of care is targeted therapy with sorafenib. However, sorafenib is associated with only marginal benefits among patients with PVTT. First-line lenvatinib , which was shown to be noninferior to sorafenib , excluded patients with main portal trunk invasion . regorafenib and nivolumab, an immune-based therapy, were recently approved in the United States for second-line therapy after sorafenib. Preliminary results for cabozantinib suggest a benefit in the second-/third-line after sorafenib failure. In addition, rapid advances in many fields (surgery, interventional radiology, nuclear medicine, and immunotherapy) have increased the potential treatment options for the management of this complex disease entity. A large portion of the emerging evidence focuses on the broader category of advanced HCC of which PVTT is a subgroup. While many of these studies show promising results, the efficacy among PVTT patients requires validation in prospective studies. Real-world data may help fill the evidence gap for patients not eligible for clinical trials due to common hepatic function requirements. The variety of new treatment advances for the heterogeneous and complex disease entity of HCC with PVTT means that personalized, multidisciplinary management may be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes.

Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of high-dose chemotherapy may have potential benefit in these patients. ### objective To evaluate clinical outcomes when HAI chemotherapy is combined with systemic chemotherapy in patients with unresectable IHC. ### Design Setting And Participants A single-institution, phase 2 clinical trial including 38 patients was conducted with HAI floxuridine plus systemic gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with unresectable IHC at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between May 20, 2013, and June 27, 2019. A confirmatory phase 1/2 study using the same therapy was conducted during the same time period at Washington University in St Louis. Patients with histologically confirmed, unresectable IHC were eligible. Resectable metastatic disease to regional lymph nodes and prior systemic therapy were permitted. Patients with distant metastatic disease were excluded. ### interventions Hepatic arterial infusion of floxuridine and systemic administration of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin . ### Main Outcomes And Measures The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) of 80% at 6 months. ### results For the phase 2 clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 42 patients with unresectable IHC were included and, of these, 38 patients were treated (13 [34%] men; median [range] age at diagnosis, 64 [39-81] years). The median follow-up was 30.5 months. Twenty-two patients (58%) achieved a partial radiographic response, and 32 patients (84%) achieved disease control at 6 months. Four patients had sufficient response to undergo resection, and 1 patient had a complete pathologic response. The median PFS was 11.8 months (1-sided 90% CI, 11.1) with a 6-month PFS rate of 84.1% (90% CI, 74.8%-infinity), thereby meeting the primary end point (6-month PFS rate, 80%). The median OS was 25.0 months (95% CI, 20.6-not reached), and the 1-year OS rate was 89.5% (95% CI, 80.2%-99.8%). Patients with resectable regional lymph nodes (18 [47%]) showed no difference in OS compared with patients with node-negative disease (24-month OS: lymph node negative: 60%; 95% CI, 40%-91% vs lymph node positive: 50%; 95% CI, 30%-83%; P\u2009=\u2009.66). Four patients (11%) had grade 4 toxic effects requiring removal from the study (1 portal hypertension, 2 gastroduodenal artery aneurysms, 1 infection in the pump pocket). Subgroup analysis showed significant improvement in survival in patients with IDH1/2 mutated tumors (2-year OS, 90%; 95% CI, 73%-99%) vs wild-type (2-year OS, 33%; 95% CI, 18%-63%) (P\u2009=\u2009.01). In the Washington University in St Louis confirmatory cohort, 9 patients (90%) achieved disease control at 6 months; the most common grade 3 toxic effect was elevated results of liver function tests, and median PFS was 12.8 months (1-sided 90% CI, 6.4). ### Conclusions And Relevance Hepatic arterial infusion plus systemic chemotherapy appears to be highly active and tolerable in patients with unresectable IHC; further evaluation is warranted.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31670750/"}

Chronic pain in the elderly is frequently a result of arthritic disorders, particularly osteoarthritis. The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as effective as standard NSAIDs for the relief of pain and for improving function in elderly patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of serious gastroduodenal adverse reactions but there is evidence that they carry a lower risk for these adverse effects than standard NSAIDs, except when there is concurrent aspirin use. Since gastroduodenal disorders are the most frequently reported serious adverse effects of NSAIDs and these disorders occur more frequently in the elderly, COX-2 inhibitors offer an alternative to standard NSAIDs in this age group. However, they are not appropriate for many patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. The adverse reaction profile of the COX-2 inhibitors has confirmed the role of the COX-2 enzyme in renal function, salt and water homeostasis and the vascular endothelium. Thus, like standard NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause renal failure, hypertension and exacerbation of cardiac failure. Of note is that these disorders are dose related. Thus, there are good reasons to avoid high doses of COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly. Clinical trials indicate that daily doses of rofecoxib 12.5 mg, celecoxib 100-200 mg, valdecoxib 10mg and etoricoxib 60 mg are the minimum effective doses of these agents. Data from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme indicate that celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are/were the most commonly prescribed doses and that 6 % of patients had taken rofecoxib 50 mg/day for longer than recommended . Recent research indicates that COX-2 inhibitors have a thrombotic potential, especially in high doses and when use is prolonged, and this further limits the extent to which they can be used in the elderly. Important interactions with COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly include those with warfarin, which can result in loss of control of anticoagulation, and those with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists and diuretics, which can result in loss of control of blood pressure and cardiac failure and, in hypovolaemic conditions, renal failure. The clinical significance of an interaction between celecoxib and aspirin to reduce the antiplatelet effect of the latter drug is unknown. Preliminary information from spontaneous reporting systems indicates that there may be differences in the risk of cardiac failure and hypertension between standard NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors and between rofecoxib and celecoxib. More formal studies using equivalent doses are needed to test this observation. Use of COX-2 inhibitors may be considered in the elderly to reduce the risk of gastroduodenal complications associated with standard NSAIDs but only when consideration has first been given to use of less toxic medicines as alternatives or supplements, the appropriate dose of the COX-2 inhibitor or standard NSAID, the presence and possible impact of co-morbidities, and the implications of taking COX-2 inhibitors with any concomitant medications. Equally important is regular monitoring of the patient taking a COX-2 inhibitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and ensuring that the patient has a continuing need to keep taking the drug. Close attention also needs to be paid to intercurrent illnesses and new prescriptions that may reduce the safety of the COX-2 inhibitor. A standard NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor may be equally effective as a COX-2 inhibitor in reducing the risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and if used the same prescribing advice applies. Current knowledge concerning the thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors suggests that this combination, if tolerated, may be preferable to a COX-2 inhibitor, particularly where prolonged use is required. This knowledge also indicates that for patients with or at high risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke, COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15813652/"}

A significant amount of AA is liberated in the presence of 2 mM EGTA, independently of Ca2+, primarily from phosphatidic acid and polyphosphoinositides (poly-PI). Quinacrine, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), suppressed AA release by about 60% and neomycin, a putative inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), reduced AA release by about 30%. An additive effect was exhibited when both inhibitors were given together. Ca2+ activated AA release. The level of Ca2+ present in the synaptoneurosomal preparation (endogenous level) and 5 microM CaCl2 enhance AA liberation by approximately 25%, whereas 2 mM CaCl2 resulted in a 50% increase in AA release relative to EGTA. The source for Ca(2+)-dependent AA release is predominantly phosphatidylinositol (PI); however, a small pool may also be liberated from neutral lipids. carbachol, an agonist of the cholinergic receptor, stimulated Ca(2+)-dependent AA release by about 17%. Bradykinin enhanced the effect of carbachol by about 10 - 15 % . This agonist-mediated AA release occurs specifically from phosphoinositides (PI + poly-PI).

A small pool of AA is probably also released by PLC, which seems to be exclusively responsible for the effect of bradykinin.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1910075/"}

The validation of coexpression was performed at the gene level in 2 independently collected cohorts of 185 and 153 ovarian cancers. ### results The presence of NF-kappaB proteins in newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancers was established, and a potential association with overall survival was identified. Transcription factors p65 and v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog B (RelB) were coexpressed with IkappaB kinase alpha, 1 component of a key trimolecular regulatory complex. Coexpression of the NF-kappaB machinery suggested activity of NF-kappaB signaling in these ovarian tumors. A significant association of p50 with poor overall survival was observed (P = .02). MMP9 expression had the opposite association, in which patients who had tumors without MMP9 staining had the poorest prognosis (P = .01), and this association held true at the gene expression level in an independently collected cohort of 185 ovarian cancers. ### conclusions The deregulation of NF-kappaB activity may influence outcome in women who receive standard therapy for advanced ovarian cancer.

The emergence of resistance to artemisinin derivatives has now been proven in South-East Asia, and there is concern that this may spread to other endemic areas. Strategies to contain and control the spread of artemisinin resistance have been proposed. On the other hand, not much attention has been given to lumefantrine. Indeed, for more than 7 years, reports have been emerging that the use of Coartem(\u00ae) is associated with rapid selection of lumefantrine-tolerant parasites.

We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methodology and summarized the quality and magnitude of relative and absolute effects for each primary outcome in our 'Summary of findings' tables. ### Main Results We identified eight studies with 4732 eligible participants and an additional 13 ongoing studies. We categorized studies into comparisons, all against standard therapy accordingly as first-line (five comparisons) or second-line therapy (one comparison) for mRCC.Interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 monotherapy probably increases one-year overall mortality compared to standard targeted therapies with temsirolimus or sunitinib (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.51; 2 studies; 1166 participants; moderate-quality evidence), may lead to similar quality of life (QoL) (e.g. MD -5.58 points, 95% CI -7.25 to -3.91 for Functional Assessment of Cancer - General (FACT-G); 1 study; 730 participants; low-quality evidence) and may slightly increase the incidence of adverse events (AEs) grade 3 or greater (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.32; 1 study; 408 participants; low-quality evidence).There is probably no difference between IFN-\u03b1 plus temsirolimus and temsirolimus alone for one-year overall mortality (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.34; 1 study; 419 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but the incidence of AEs of 3 or greater may be increased (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.45; 1 study; 416 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no information on QoL.IFN-\u03b1 alone may slightly increase one-year overall mortality compared to IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.36; 2 studies; 1381 participants; low-quality evidence).

QoL could not be evaluated due to insufficient data.Treatment with vaccines (e.g. MVA-5T4 or IMA901) or standard therapy may lead to similar one-year overall mortality (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.32; low-quality evidence) and AEs of grade 3 or greater (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.39; 2 studies; 1065 participants; low-quality evidence). QoL could not be evaluated due to insufficient data.In previously treated patients, targeted immunotherapy (nivolumab) probably reduces one-year overall mortality compared to standard targeted therapy with everolimus (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.87; 1 study; 821 participants; moderate-quality evidence), probably improves QoL (e.g. RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.78 for clinically relevant improvement of the FACT-Kidney Symptom Index Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS); 1 study, 704 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and probably reduces the incidence of AEs grade 3 or greater (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.65; 1 study; 803 participants; moderate-quality evidence). ### Authors Conclusions Evidence of moderate quality demonstrates that IFN-\u03b1 monotherapy increases mortality compared to standard targeted therapies alone, whereas there is no difference if IFN is combined with standard targeted therapies. Evidence of low quality demonstrates that QoL is worse with IFN alone and that severe AEs are increased with IFN alone or in combination. There is low-quality evidence that IFN-\u03b1 alone increases mortality but moderate-quality evidence on decreased AEs compared to IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab. Low-quality evidence shows no difference for IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab compared to sunitinib with respect to mortality and severe AEs. Low-quality evidence demonstrates no difference of vaccine treatment compared to standard targeted therapies in mortality and AEs, whereas there is moderate-quality evidence that targeted immunotherapies reduce mortality and AEs and improve QoL.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28504837/"}

These elevated levels persisted throughout the treatment period. There was no influence of sunitinib on the frequency of Treg in our cohort of patients. sorafenib, but not sunitinib, leads to an early and sustained increase in Treg in PB of mRCC patients. In immunoresponsive tumors such as RCC, immunological effects of kinase inhibitors are particularly relevant for the design of combination trials with immunotherapeutic agents. Our study suggests that sorafenib should be avoided in such a therapeutic setting.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22156795/"}

Repetitive spike bursts were recorded in the duodenum (0.5-1/h), disrupting the gastroduodenal coordination and preceding a phase III in the jejunum. ROCs appeared spontaneously in fasted animals and in 75% of the recordings during the dark period. Four consecutive intestinal myoelectrical patterns have been described during a ROC. Briefly, they consisted in series of high-speed propagated abroad contractions of great amplitude that progressively changed into others of orad direction. In relation to the MMC, the ROC pattern appeared just after a phase III reached the distal ileum, and a pattern of duodenal repetitive spike bursts, followed by a migrating phase III in the jejunum, started at the duodenum after a ROC.

For FACT-P domains where there was an interaction between the treatment arm and age, we constructed separate models for patients aged <75 and \u226575yr. We compared the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful change from baseline for FACT-P, and the proportion of patients with an abnormal score and median change from baseline for PHQ-9 and MoCA using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test. ### Results And Limitations In the MMRM analysis, there was a positive test for interaction in the treatment arm by age for total FACT-P (p=0.048). FACT-P change from baseline over time was better for abiraterone than for enzalutamide in the \u226575-yr model ( p=0.003 ) , with no difference in the < 75-yr model ( p>0.9 ) . A higher proportion of patients experienced clinically meaningful worsening with enzalutamide for the physical and functional well-being domains (37% vs 21%, p=0.013; 39% vs 23%, p=0.015). The distribution of change in PHQ-9 scores from baseline favored abiraterone at weeks 4, 8, and 12. These analyses were not prespecified, and results should be considered to be hypothesis generating. ### conclusions Patient-reported outcomes favored abiraterone compared with enzalutamide with differences in FACT-P HRQoL and PHQ-9 depression scores. Differences in the total FACT-P scores were seen only in the elderly patient subgroup. ### Patient Summary In this report, we examined the change in patient-reported quality-of-life scores from the start of treatment over time for patients treated with abiraterone versus enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We found that elderly patients treated with abiraterone had better quality of life over time, with no difference between treatments for the younger subgroup of patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30591354/"}

Our re-analysis relied on standard equivalence methods in which interpretation is based on Relative Risks (RRs) along with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The equivalence margins employed in our statistical testing were directly derived from those reported in randomized studies. ### results The equivalence margins were initially set at RR ranging from 0.775 to 1.29. According to these margins, triple therapy based on any NOAC proved to be superior to dual therapy alone, but at the same time demonstrated its equivalence with dual therapy. The results for apixaban-based triple therapy were inconclusive (not superior, not not-inferior, not equivalent and, of course, not inferior to the controls). Those for rivaroxaban-based triple therapy showed that this combination treatment was superior to dual therapy alone and failed to meet the criterion of equivalence. In the comparison between rivaroxaban-based triple therapy and ticagrelor + aspirin , the RR was 1 and its 95 % CI remained within a post-hoc margin of \u00b1 15 % . ### conclusions Even if one considers the most effective NOAC in combination with clopidogrel + ticagrelor, this triple therapy is not more effective than ticagrelor + aspirin. On the other hand, the increased risk of bleeding with triple regimens is well demonstrated. We therefore conclude that these triple regimens did not play any important roles in the patients experiencing an acute coronary syndrome.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25177676/"}

Infectious episodes were classified as cure or failure. ### results Thirteen patients were included (10 nosocomial pneumonia, 3 nosocomial intra-abdominal infections). The median [25th-75th percentiles] admission SAPS2 score was 54 [51-69] and the median SOFA score at the beginning of infection was 7 [4-8]. The median CPIS scores for pneumonia at the beginning and end of treatment were 9 [7-10.5] and 2 [0.75-5.5]. The duration of treatment with the combination of aztreonam plus cefepime was 14 days [9.5-16]. Nine episodes were classified as cures and 4 as failures, indicating a clinical efficacy of 69.2%. Overall mortality was 38.5%. ### discussion These data suggest that the association of cefepime plus aztreonam could be an attractive alternative in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant PA to all \u03b2-lactams with a clinical efficacy rate of 69%.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26004874/"}

PARP inhibitors have moved into clinical practice in the past few years, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) within the past 2 years.

The potent CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine has recently been shown also to be an effective inhibitor of the CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of the antimalarial drug proguanil in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to confirm this interaction in vitro. ### methods A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to assay 4-chlorophenylbiguanide (4-CPBG) and cycloguanil formed from proguanil by microsomes prepared from human liver. The limit of detection was 0.08 nmol mg-'. h-I. ### results The formation of 4-CPBG and cycloguanil could be described by one-enzyme kinetics, indicating that the formation of the two metabolites is almost exclusively catalysed by a single enzyme, i.e. CYP2C19 within the concentration range used, or that the contribution of an alternative low-affinity enzyme, probably CYP3A4, is very low. This notion was confirmed by the lack of potent inhibition by four CYP3A4 inhibitors: ketoconazole, bromocriptine, midazolam and dihydroergotamine. fluvoxamine was a very effective inhibitor of the oxidation of proguanil, displaying Ki values of 0.69 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of cycloguanil formation and 4.7 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of 4-CPBG formation. As expected, the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole inhibited the formation of both metabolites with an IC50 of 10 micromol x l(-1). Norfluoxetine and sulfaphenazole inhibited proguanil oxidation with Ki values of 7.3-16 micromol x l(-1), suggesting that the two compounds are moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19. ### conclusions Fluvoxamine is a fairly potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and it has the potential for causing drug-drug interactions with substrates for CYP2C19 such as imipramine , clomipramine , amitriptyline and diazepam .

Over the past decade , paclitaxel , docetaxel , vinorelbine , gemcitabine , irinotecan , and topotecan have been introduced into the clinic . These newer agents have shown promising activity against NSCLC with a favorable toxicity profile as single agents. For patients with metastatic NSCLC, palliation is the main goal of therapy. Therefore, treatment should be easy to administer on an outpatient basis. We explored a novel combination therapy avoiding platinum. Patients with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC were treated with intravenous (i.v.) topotecan (0.5-1.0 mg/m(2)/day x 5) and i.v. vinorelbine (20-30 mg/m(2)/day on day 1 and day 5) in 21-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined separately with or without the addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. Twenty-nine patients have been enrolled to date. At i.v. topotecan doses of 0.75-1.0 mg/m(2)/day and i.v. vinorelbine of 25 mg/m(2)/day, neutropenia was frequent but of short duration (<7 days). The DLT of i.v. topotecan (0.85 mg/m(2)) in the absence of G-CSF support was based on myelosuppression with neutropenic fever. With the addition of G-CSF, a DLT has not been reached. Nonhematologic toxicities included mild to moderate fatigue and constipation. An overall clinical response rate of 42% was achieved, with responses noted at all dose levels. At a short median follow-up of 15 months, the median survival for all patients is 13 months. In conclusion, the combination regimen of topotecan and vinorelbine is feasible for outpatient administration and is well tolerated with less toxicity than platinum-based regimens.

Additionally, atenolol and metoprolol were evaluated to see whether differential delivery to the brain contributed to the observed lack of effect of systemically administered beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists. ICV administration of pindolol (45 or 90 micrograms) was followed by a suppression of copulation.

It is impossible to unravel such problems without using a systems approach, i.e. focussing on processes, not just molecular components.

Samples for viable counts and endotoxin analysis were drawn immediately before and after the addition of the antibiotics and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For the analysis of endotoxin, a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay was used. ### results Endotoxin liberation was found to be proportional to the number of killed bacteria for each antibiotic regimen at each concentration level justifying the endotoxin-liberating potential to be expressed as release of endotoxin per killed bacterium, an expression that was independent of the inoculum size. At all concentration levels there was a statistically significant difference between the treatments, with the highest release of endotoxin per killed bacterium for cefuroxime, lower for tobramycin and the lowest for the combination of the two drugs (P < 0.001). With increasing doses, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the propensity to release endotoxin. When the bacterial killing rate was correlated to the propensity to release endotoxin in bacteria exposed to tobramycin or the combination of tobramycin and cefuroxime, a significant negative correlation was found (P < 0.01). This reduction in endotoxin release was not caused by an unspecific endotoxin binding of tobramycin. ### conclusions Addition of tobramycin reduced the cefuroxime-induced endotoxin release per killed bacterium to a level which was even lower than that of tobramycin alone in spite of an increased killing rate. Increasing concentrations of tobramycin led to reduction in endotoxin release, which may be of benefit when dosing aminoglycosides once daily.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11168076/"}

The protein kinase phosphatase 1 nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS) has recently been shown to interact with c-Myc protein and suppresses c-Myc protein degradation. Here we screened the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-Approved Oncology Drugs Set V from the National Cancer Institute, and identified tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including ponatinib and lapatinib, as the Approved Oncology Drugs exerting the best synergistic anticancer effects with THZ1 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.

These agents were investigated in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first-line setting. ### methods The systematic review was executed on January 27, 2015, and updated on August 21, 2016, using a pre-specified search strategy. Searches were conducted using PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE, with supplemental searches using the Evidence Based Medicine Reviews and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs published in English from 1995-2016 and reporting at least one of the primary outcomes [overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, or quality of life] in patients who received first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool, respectively. A Baysian network meta-analysis was performed on the primary outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) were evaluated for the primary analysis; secondary analyses were conducted using median OS data.

Reverse phase protein array analysis of the synergistic treatment indicated involvement of not only MEK and PI3K signaling pathways but also others associated with glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, gene transcription, histone methylation, iron transport, stress response, cell cycle, and apoptosis. ### conclusion Inhibiting RTK and RAF/MEK or PI3K could induce synergistic cytotoxicity but personalization is necessary. Examining colonies in agarose initiated by GICs from each patient may be useful for drug sensitivity testing in personalized cancer therapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26861698/"}

Given this activity, it seemed logical to attempt to combine paclitaxel with doxorubicin, the other most active single agent in metastatic breast cancer. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performed two trials investigating paclitaxel/doxorubicin combinations in patients with advanced breast cancer in an attempt to identify a tolerable dose and schedule of the combination. In the first trial , paclitaxel and doxorubicin were alternated every 3 weeks in doses of 200 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 , respectively , for patients who had received no more than one prior chemotherapeutic regimen . Therapy was well tolerated in this setting. At these doses, paclitaxel induced more granulocytopenia and less thrombocytopenia than did doxorubicin. Objective responses (complete and partial responses) were seen in seven of 12 patients; two other patients had improved disease (relief of pain in bony metastases). A second limited-institution Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial evaluated paclitaxel and doxorubicin given in combination. In this phase I trial, doxorubicin was given as an intravenous push and paclitaxel as a 24-hour continuous infusion. The sequence of drug administration (D-->P or P-->D) was alternated both between and within patients, so that we might evaluate the effect of administration schedule on toxicity. Therapy was begun at an initial paclitaxel dose of 150 mg/m2 and an initial doxorubicin dose of 50 mg/m2 in six patients, with a subsequent six patients receiving 175 and 60 mg/m2, respectively, of paclitaxel and doxorubicin. In addition, patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d. While therapy at the initial dose level was well tolerated, dose-limiting mucositis was seen at the second dose level, although only when paclitaxel preceded doxorubicin. This suggests that sequence of drug administration in paclitaxel-based regimens may play an important role as a determinant of toxicity and (perhaps) efficacy, a finding similar to that seen when paclitaxel and cisplatin were combined in patients with ovarian cancer. Based on this study, we identified the sequence of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) followed by paclitaxel (150 mg/m2) to be the maximum tolerated dose. This combination is currently being compared with paclitaxel alone and doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced breast cancer in an intergroup trial led by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7939756/"}

Patients with CS suffer from a variety of comorbidities that increase the risk of mortality. Surgical resection of the disease-causing lesion is generally the first-line treatment of CS. However, some patients may not be eligible for surgery due to comorbidities, and approximately 25\u00a0% of patients, especially those with CD, have recurrent disease. For these patients, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors may control cortisol elevation and subsequent symptomatology. CS is rare overall, and clinical studies of adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors are often small and, in many cases, data are limited regarding the efficacy and safety of these treatments.

The planned sample size was 120, expecting a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.0 with non-inferiority margin of 1.3 (one-sided alpha error 0.2 and power 0.7). Major secondary end-points were overall survival (OS), response rate\u00a0and safety. ### results From December 2011 to September 2014, 121 patients were enrolled, and 61 and 59 patients were randomised to the panitumumab and cetuximab arms, respectively (1 patient excluded).

Randomisation was done with permuted blocks, and stratified according to the two-arm or four-arm randomisation option, participating institution, and chemotherapy use. Patients, investigators, data managers, and medical reviewers were masked. The primary efficacy endpoint was disease-free survival (events were invasive breast cancer relapse, second primaries [contralateral breast and non-breast], or death without previous cancer event). Secondary endpoints were overall survival, distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI). The monotherapy comparison included patients randomly assigned to tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years.

At a median follow-up of 8\u00b70 years from randomisation (range 0-11\u00b72) for the comparison of the sequential groups with letrozole monotherapy, there were no statistically significant differences in any of the four endpoints for either sequence. 8-year intention-to-treat estimates (each with SE \u22641\u00b71%) for letrozole monotherapy, letrozole followed by tamoxifen, and tamoxifen followed by letrozole were 78\u00b76%, 77\u00b78%, 77\u00b73% for disease-free survival; 87\u00b75%, 87\u00b77%, 85\u00b79% for overall survival; 89\u00b79%, 88\u00b77%, 88\u00b71% for DRFI; and 86\u00b71%, 85\u00b73%, 84\u00b73% for BCFI. ### interpretation For postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer, a reduction in breast cancer recurrence and mortality is obtained by letrozole monotherapy when compared with tamoxifen montherapy. Sequential treatments involving tamoxifen and letrozole do not improve outcome compared with letrozole monotherapy, but might be useful strategies when considering an individual patient's risk of recurrence and treatment tolerability. ### funding Novartis, United States National Cancer Institute, International Breast Cancer Study Group.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22018631/"}

AIs can be used in several adjuvant endocrine settings: as upfront therapy, switch to an AI after 2-3years of tamoxifen or extended therapy following 5years of tamoxifen. In the switch setting, two different types of study designs have been utilized. One is a late randomization design which randomizes patients who are disease-free after 2-3years of tamoxifen to receive an AI versus continuation of tamoxifen. In contrast, an early randomization design randomizes all patients immediately after primary treatment and prior to starting tamoxifen. Efficacy benefits with AIs have been shown in several trials evaluating the late randomization strategy, including the Intergroup exemestane Study, the Italian tamoxifen anastrozole trial and the anastrozole-Nolvadex 95 trial.

These results demonstrated that digoxin might be used as a promising adjuvant sensitizer to reverse chemoresistance of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine via inhibiting Nrf2 signaling.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30735911/"}

A density functional study. To examine how azole inhibitors interact with the heme active site of the cytochrome P450 enzymes, we have performed a series of density functional theory studies on azole binding. These are the first density functional studies on azole interactions with a heme center and give fundamental insight into how azoles inhibit the catalytic function of P450 enzymes. Since azoles come in many varieties, we tested three typical azole motifs representing a broad range of azole and azole-type inhibitors: methylimidazolate, methyltriazolate, and pyridine. These structural motifs represent typical azoles , such as econazole , fluconazole , and metyrapone . The calculations show that azole binding is a stepwise mechanism whereby first the water molecule from the resting state of P450 is released from the sixth binding site of the heme to create a pentacoordinated active site followed by coordination of the azole nitrogen to the heme iron. This process leads to the breaking of a hydrogen bond between the resting state water molecule and the approaching inhibitor molecule. Although, formally, the water molecule is released in the first step of the reaction mechanism and a pentacoordinated heme is created, this does not lead to an observed spin state crossing. Thus, we show that release of a water molecule from the resting state of P450 enzymes to create a pentacoordinated heme will lead to a doublet to quartet spin state crossing at an Fe-OH(2) distance of approximately 3.0 A, while the azole substitution process takes place at shorter distances. Azoles bind heme with significantly stronger binding energies than a water molecule, so that these inhibitors block the catalytic cycle of the enzyme and prevent oxygen binding and the catalysis of substrate oxidation. Perturbations within the active site (e.g., a polarized environment) have little effect on the relative energies of azole binding. Studies with an extra hydrogen-bonded ethanol molecule in the model, mimicking the active site of the CYP121 P450, show that the resting state and azole binding structures are close in energy, which may lead to chemical equilibrium between the two structures, as indeed observed with recent protein structural studies that have demonstrated two distinct azole binding mechanisms to P450 heme.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18563875/"}

In this follow-up study, patients with disease progression following initial clinical benefit-ie, a partial repsonse or stable disease-were eligible for retreatment and with the same doses and schedules for tremelimumab and durvalumab as used in the NIBIT-MESO-1 trial. The primary endpoint, immune-related objective response rate, was evaluated per immune-related modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or immune-related RECIST 1.1 criteria for patients with pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma, respectively.

At data cut-off, April 30, 2020, five (13%) of 40 patients were alive, and 35 (88%) patients had died of progressive disease. At a median follow-up of 52 months (IQR 49-53), median overall survival was 16\u00b75 months (95% CI 13\u00b77-19\u00b72). Survival was 20% (eight of 40 patients) at 36 months and 15% (six of 40 patients) and 48 months. 17 (43%) of 40 patients met the criteria for enrolment in the retreatment study and were retreated with at least one dose of tremelimumab and durvalumab. No immune-related objective responses were observed in the 17 retreated patients. Seven (41%) of 17 patients achieved immune-related stable disease. From the start of retreatment to a median follow-up of 24 months (22\u00b70-25\u00b70), median overall survival was 12\u00b75 months (95% CI 0\u00b70-25\u00b78), and survival at 12 months was 52\u00b79%, at 18 months was 35\u00b73%, and at 24 months was 23\u00b75%. There were no grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the retreatment cohort. In a post-hoc analysis of 28 patients for whom tumour tissue before treatment was available, patients with a TMB higher than the median value of 8\u00b73 mutations per Mb had a higher median overall survival compared with patients with TMB below the median value, but this difference was non-significant.

Results of a population pharmacokinetic study in a subgroup of 371 patients and a separate rifampin-imatinib drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers are presented. ### conclusions On December 20, 2002, imatinib was granted accelerated approval under subpart H, rather than regular approval. Follow-up is short compared with the natural history of chronic phase CML or more mature results with established therapies such as IFN-alpha or transplantation. If imatinib should stop working after 1.5-2 years, the results could be importantly different from the present analysis. As a Phase IV postmarketing commitment, the applicant has agreed to provide follow-up reports on this imatinib study annually for the next 6 years.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12796358/"}

Seven groups of recipient mice (n=10-28) received various combinations of the following treatment protocols: sirolimus, 1.5 mg/kg (3.0 mg/kg for xenografts) every other day from day 0 to day 12; cyclosporine, 50 mg/kg every other day from day 10 through 22; ALS, 0.5 ml on days -1 and 2 for allografts and days -1, 2, and 4 for xenografts; and BM, 25 million donor-specific cells IV on day 7. ### results The administration of ALS or ALS/BM resulted in modest but significant prolongation of skin graft survival in all combinations tested. cyclosporine combined with ALS or ALS/BM significantly extended allograft survival compared with ALS or ALS/BM alone (P<0.05) but had no effect on xenograft survival. In contrast, the combination of sirolimus with ALS or ALS/BM resulted in a two- to threefold increase in allograft survival and over a fourfold increase in xenograft survival when compared with the comparable cyclosporine-based regimen.

After a median follow-up period of 7 years, there was no statistical difference of progression-free survival (doxorubicin plus cisplatin, 191; docetaxel plus cisplatin, 208; paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 187; P\u2009=\u2009.12) or overall survival (doxorubicin plus cisplatin, 217; docetaxel plus cisplatin, 223; paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 215; P\u2009=\u2009.67) among the 3 groups. The 5-year progression-free survival rate was 73.3% for the doxorubicin plus cisplatin group, 79.0% for the docetaxel plus cisplatin group, and 73.9% for the paclitaxel plus carboplatin group, while the 5-year overall survival rates were 82.7%, 88.1%, and 86.1%, respectively. ### Conclusions And Relevance There was no significant difference of survival among patients receiving doxorubicin plus cisplatin, docetaxel plus cisplatin, or paclitaxel plus carboplatin as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for endometrial cancer. Because each regimen showed adequate tolerability but different toxic effects, taxane plus platinum regimens may be a reasonable alternative to treatment with doxorubicin plus cisplatin. ### Trial Registration UMIN-CTR identifier: UMIN000000522.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30896757/"}

At the last dose level of curcumin, three dose-limiting toxicities were observed and two out of three patients at this dose level refused to continue treatment, leading us to define the maximal tolerated dose of curcumin at 8,000 mg/d. Eight patients out of 14 had measurable lesions according to RECIST criteria, with five PR and three SD. Some improvements as biological and clinical responses were observed in most patients. ### Patients And Methods Patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer were eligible. docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) was administered as a 1 h i.v. infusion every 3 w on d 1 for six cycles. curcumin was orally given from 500 mg/d for seven consecutive d by cycle (from d-4 to d+2) and escalated until a dose-limiting toxicity should occur.

A comparative study of human atrial fibers (HAF), human ventricular fibers (HVF), frog ventricle, and frog skeletal muscle demonstrated marked differences in tension development in the presence of diltiazem. There was no significant difference between the tension developed by HAF and by HVF over a range of diltiazem concentrations when the differences in resting membrane potential were corrected by increasing external K+ concentration. In human myocardium, diltiazem resulted in both a voltage and use-dependent blockade of the calcium channel. Comparison of the tension-dose response curves in human myocardium, frog ventricle and skeletal muscle showed that diltiazem was most effective at decreasing tension in frog heart, and least effective in skeletal muscle with human myocardium being intermediate. In skeletal muscle, neither tension development nor the birefringence signal related to the Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was significantly altered by diltiazem in concentrations less than 10(-6) M, but in concentrations greater than 10(-5) M both were suppressed.

However, the molecular mechanisms which mediate this redistribution of lymphocytes from lymphocyte reservoirs into the circulation remain unknown. We hypothesized that this form of lymphocytosis was in part due to shedding of cell adhesion molecules from the cell surface and a subsequent detachment of lymphocytes adhering to the vascular endothelium in lymphocyte reservoirs. In this study, healthy human volunteers (n = 12) were exercised on a treadmill until exhaustion. The circulating levels of the soluble cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-Selectin were determined by ELISA.

This highly significant effect of exercise on circulating ICAM-1 levels (p < .005) was mitigated after treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonists.

Selective inhibitors of 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type I may be of therapeutical interest for two reasons: i) 9alpha-Fluorinated 11-dehydrosteroids like 11-dehydro-dexamethasone (DH-D) are rapidly activated by human kidney 11beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type II (11beta-HSD-II) to dexamethasone (D). If the same reaction by hepatic 11beta-HSD-I could be selectively inhibited, DH-D could be used for selective renal immunosuppressive therapy. ii) Reduction of cortisone to cortisol in the liver may increase insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and inhibition of the enzyme may lead to a decrease in gluconeogenesis. Therefore, we characterized the metabolism of DH-D by human hepatic 11beta-HSD-I and tried to find a selective inhibitor of this isoenzyme. ### methods For kinetic analysis of 11beta-HSD-I, we used microsomes prepared from unaffected parts of liver segments, resected because of hepatocarcinoma or metastatic disease. For inhibition experiments, we also tested 11beta-HSD-II activity with human kidney cortex microsomes. The inhibitory potency of several compounds was evaluated for oxidation and reduction in concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-5)mol/l. ### results Whereas D was not oxidized by human liver microsomes at all, cortisol was oxidized to cortisone with a maximum velocity (V(max)) of 95pmol/mg per min. The reduction of DH-D to D (V(max)=742pmol/mg per min, Michaelis--Menten constant (K(m))=1.6 micromol/l) was faster than that of cortisone to cortisol (V(max)=187pmol/mg per min). All reactions tested in liver microsomes showed the characteristics of 11beta-HSD-I: K(m) values in the micromolar range, preferred cosubstrate NADP(H), no product inhibition. Of the substances tested for inhibition of 11beta-HSD-I and -II , chenodeoxycholic acid was the only one that selectively inhibited 11beta-HSD-I ( IC(50 ) for reduction : 2.8x10(-6)mol/l , IC(50 ) for oxidation : 4.4x10(-6)mol/l ) , whereas ketoconazole preferentially inhibited oxidation and reduction reactions catalyzed by 11beta-HSD-II . metyrapone, which is reduced to metyrapol by hepatic 11beta-HSD-I, inhibited steroid reductase activity of 11beta-HSD-I and -II and oxidative activity of 11beta-HSD-II. These findings can be explained by substrate competition for reductase reactions and by product inhibition of the oxidation, which is a well-known characteristic of 11beta-HSD-II. ### conclusions Our in vitro results may offer a new concept for renal glucocorticoid targeting. Oral administration of small amounts of DH-D (low substrate affinity for 11beta-HSD-I) in combination with chenodeoxycholic acid (selective inhibition of 11beta-HSD-I) may prevent hepatic first pass reduction of DH-D, thus allowing selective activation of DH-D to D by the high affinity 11beta-HSD-II in the kidney. Moreover, selective inhibitors of the hepatic 11beta-HSD-I, like chenodeoxycholic acid, may become useful in the therapy of patients with hepatic insulin resistance including diabetes mellitus type II, because cortisol enhances gluconeogenesis.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10664531/"}

Oral involvement was the first clinical evidence of sarcoidosis in seven cases and was a relapse symptom in five cases. Clinical presentations were nodules (n = 7) or ulcers (n = 5) and were mostly solitary. The tongue was the commonest site affected (n = 4), followed by lips (n = 3), oral mucosa (n = 2), palate (n = 2) and gingiva (n = 1). Patients with oral sarcoidosis were significantly younger and had more frequent lacrimal or salivary glands and upper airway tract clinical involvement than the controls; increased angiotensin-converting enzyme was less frequent in oral sarcoidosis. Multiple treatments of oral sarcoidosis were used: no treatment (n = 3), surgery (n = 2), corticosteroids (n = 7), hydroxychloroquine (n = 3), methotrexate (n = 2), doxycycline (n = 1).

Mutations in the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase gene (KIT), which result in constitutive activation of the protein (KIT), are causally related to the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). imatinib, a targeted anticancer drug, exerts a therapeutic effect against GISTs by repressing the kinase activity of KIT. Long-term administration of this drug, however, causes the emergence of imatinib-resistant GISTs. We performed quantitative phosphoproteome analysis using a cell-based GIST model system comprising an imatinib-sensitive GIST cell line (GIST882), GIST882 under treatment with imatinib (GIST882-IM), and secondary imatinib-resistant GIST882 (GIST882-R). Phosphorylated peptides were purified from each cell line using titania-based affinity chromatography or anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation, and then subjected to LC-MS/MS based quantitative phosphoproteome analysis. Using this method we identified augmentation of the kinase activities of multiple elements of the signal transduction pathway, especially KIT and EGFR. Although, these elements were up-regulated in GIST882-R, no additionally mutated KIT mRNA was found in secondary imatinib-resistant GIST cells.

In imatinib-resistant GIST cells, we observed elevated expression of KIT and restoration of its kinase activity, as well as activation of multiple proliferative signaling pathways. Our results indicate that the effects of even so-called 'molecularly targeted' drugs, are broad rather than convergent, and that the mechanisms of action of such drugs during continuous administration are extremely complex.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554490/"}

Current treatment guidelines prefer the longer-acting agent, palonosetron, for CINV prevention in some chemotherapy regimens. A new granisetron formulation, APF530, has been developed as an alternative long-acting agent. APF530 utilizes Biochronomer(\u2122) technology to formulate a viscous tri(ethylene glycol) poly(orthoester)-based formulation that delivers - by single subcutaneous (SC) injection - therapeutic granisetron concentrations over 5 days.

Morphologically, the level of inflammation is determined by the concentration and degree of activation of microglial cells. Biochemically, it is judged by the presence of a spectrum of inflammatory mediators. Epidemiological evidence indicates that anti-inflammatory agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a sparing effect on AD and PD indicating that inflammation exacerbates the pathology in these diseases. NSAIDs are protective in transgenic animal models of AD, providing further evidence of the negative consequences of inflammation. Here we describe an in vitro model, which was used to study the protective effects of NSAIDs in AD. This model is based on neuronal cell killing by stimulated microglia or microglia-like cells. In this model NSAIDs show protective effects at a therapeutically relevant level, which is in the low micromolar range.

This study aimed to examine pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between this regimen and dolutegravir, a first-line antiretroviral medication. ### methods This was a single-center, open-label, fixed-sequence, drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers. Subjects received oral dolutegravir 50 mg once daily alone (days 1-4) and concomitantly with once-weekly isoniazid 900 mg, rifapentine 900 mg, and pyridoxine 50 mg (days 5-19). dolutegravir concentrations were measured on days 4, 14, and 19, and rifapentine, 25-desacetyl-rifapentine, and isoniazid concentrations were measured on day 19. Cytokines and antidrug antibodies to isoniazid and rifapentine were examined at select time points. ### results The study was terminated following the development of flu-like syndrome and elevated aminotransferase levels in 2 of 4 subjects after the third isoniazid-rifapentine dose. Markedly elevated levels of interferon-\u03b3, CXCL10, C-reactive protein, and other cytokines were temporally associated with symptoms. Antidrug antibodies were infrequently detected. dolutegravir area under the curve (AUC) was decreased by 46% (90% confidence interval, 27-110%; P = .13) on day 14. rifapentine and 25-desacetyl rifapentine levels on day 19 were comparable to reference data, whereas isoniazid AUCs were approximately 67%-92% higher in the subjects who developed toxicities. ### conclusions The combined use of dolutegravir with once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine resulted in unexpected and serious toxicities that were mediated by endogenous cytokine release. Additional investigations are necessary to examine the safety and efficacy of coadministering these medications. ### Clinical Trials Registration NCT02771249.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29415190/"}

Resistance is a significant limitation to the effectiveness of cancer therapies. The PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways play important roles in a variety of normal cellular processes and tumorigenesis. This study is designed to explore the relationship of these signaling pathways with multidrug resistance in prostate cancer (PCa). The PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways were investigated utilizing paclitaxel resistant DU145-TxR PCa cells and their parental non-resistant DU145 cells to determine their relationship with resistance to paclitaxel and other anticancer drugs. Our results demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways are upregulated in DU145-TxR cells compared to the DU145 cells. Inactivating these pathways using the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 or the MAP kinase pathway inhibitor PD98059 renders the DU145-TxR cells more sensitive to paclitaxel. We investigated the effects of these inhibitors on other anticancer drugs including docetaxel , vinblastine , doxorubicin , 10-Hydroxycamptothecin ( 10-HCPT ) and cisplatin and find that both inhibitors induces DU145-TxR cells to be more sensitive only to the microtubule-targeting drugs ( paclitaxel , docetaxel and vinblastine ) . Furthermore, the treatment with these inhibitors induces cleaved-PARP production in DU145-TxR cells, suggesting that apoptosis induction might be one of the mechanisms for the reversal of drug resistance. In conclusion, the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways are associated with resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Inactivating these pathways renders these PCa cells more sensitive to microtubule-targeting drugs such as paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinblastine.

The history of anti-obesity drug development is far from glorious, with transient magic bullets and only a handful of agents currently licensed for clinical use. In view of recent progress in our understanding of the multiplicity of signalling pathways involved in appetite regulation, and the resultant deluge of reports on the anorectic efficacy of novel therapies, it seems timely to stress the need to differentiate treatments that suppress intake by primary means from those that only indirectly achieve this endpoint. The current article reviews the conceptual history of the behavioural satiety sequence (BSS), also known as the behavioural sequence of satiety, post-ingestive satiety, and the postprandial satiety sequence. Early research confirmed that natural satiation, produced by a caloric load on the gut, is associated with a predictable transition from feeding through grooming to resting. Although many less naturalistic manipulations are also capable of reducing food intake, very few do so without disrupting the normal structure of this feeding cycle. Thus, while CCK and d-fenfluramine reduce intake by accelerating but otherwise maintaining the integrity of the BSS, other anorectic interventions disrupt the BSS through response competition (e.g. d-amphetamine), nausea/discomfort (e.g. lithium chloride) and/or interference with taste-mediated positive feedback (e.g. quinine adulteration of the diet). A substantial literature now strongly supports the specific involvement of serotonin 5-HT(1B ) and 5-HT(2C ) receptor subtypes in satiety and in the anorectic effect of agents such as fenfluramine and fluoxetine . Recent BSS analyses have also identified rather selective anorectic profiles for the dual noradrenaline and 5-HT reuptake inhibitor sibutramine, the orexin-1 receptor antagonist SB-334867, and the broad spectrum opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. However, similar analyses have offered little/no support for the anorectic potential of the gut peptide PYY(3-36) while the acute anorectic efficacy of cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonists appears largely to be secondary to response competition. In contrast, studies with low-dose combinations of naloxone and CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonists have very recently confirmed the potential of drug polytherapies not only in appetite suppression but also in attenuating/eliminating unwanted side-effects. In sum, as BSS analysis offers a reliable means of differentiating the wheat (primary anorectics) from the chaff (secondary anorectics), it should form an integral part of early phase testing in any anti-obesity drug screening programme.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20214921/"}

In the presence of an epithelial Na(+) channel blocker, amiloride, neither carbachol nor pilocarpine affected the Na(+) level of secreted saliva; however, it significantly increased the Na(+) content of cevimeline-induced saliva. The intracellular Ca(2+) response of acinar cells was almost identical among all three agents, although recovery after drug removal was slower for cevimeline and pilocarpine. A profound decrease in intracellular pH was observed during pilocarpine and carbachol treatment, whereas intracellular acidification induced by cevimeline was only seen in the presence of a Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitor.

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by excellent response to treatment, if diagnosed correctly. Lifestyle advice is an integral part of the treatment of JME; it should include recommendations on avoidance of common triggers such as sleep deprivation and alcohol excess and emphasis on the importance of compliance with medication. The drug of first choice in the treatment of JME is sodium valproate, which has a response rate of up to 80%. Valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing age because of significantly increased risks of fetal malformations and neurodevelopmental delay. levetiracetam or lamotrigine are alternative first-line options if valproate is contraindicated. With limited data from trials to support either of these drugs, the choice should take into account comorbidity factors and patient priorities. Because of its low side effect profile, excellent tolerability, and lack of interactions with other drugs, levetiracetam is our preferred alternative first-line agent. lamotrigine is another first-line option but may exacerbate myoclonus. The failure of valproate or failure of two first-line antiepileptic drugs suggests that combination therapy is indicated. Drug interactions and the patient's gender, age, and comorbidities need to be considered. levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and valproate are suitable adjuncts, with a synergistic effect reported from the combination of valproate and lamotrigine. clonazepam is a useful adjunct for myoclonus and can be used in combination with lamotrigine to avoid lamotrigine's myoclonic effects. In women of childbearing potential , valproate should be considered if levetiracetam and lamotrigine have failed to control seizures at this stage . topiramate is a cost-effective alternative monotherapy, but because of its poor tolerability, we recommend it as add-on treatment only. zonisamide should remain a second-line adjunct in the treatment of JME, owing to the lack of supportive data. Phenobarbital is the most cost-effective drug and can be used to control the seizures of JME when antiepileptic drugs are limited or too costly. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin can exacerbate absences and myoclonus and are therefore contraindicated, although they can improve control of tonic-clonic seizures when these are refractory to other medication. gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, and vigabatrin are contraindicated and can worsen seizures.

Mean PsA evolution was 2.7 years (0.8-11.2). The most common forms were peripheral (47/102, 45.1%) and mixed (46/102, 46.1%) PsA. The anti-TNF treatment initiated was etanercept in 47 cases (45.2%), adalimumab in 29 (27.9%), infliximab in 20 (19.2%), and golimumab in six [5.8%]. In 28 cases (27.4%), anti-TNF was associated with methotrexate (MTX). Overall, the median duration of anti-TNF retention was 76.5 months. The hazard ratios (HR) for treatment cessation did not significantly differ between the etanercept and monoclonal antibody groups (HR=1.35[0.96-1.93], p=0.08).

CAH is an uncommon disorder that results from a defect in steroid hormones biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex. The clinical presentation depends on the site of enzymatic mutations and the types of accumulated steroid precursors. A 22-year-old woman who was diagnosed to have hypertension since the age of 10 years who was treated with anti-hypertensive therapy was referred to the National Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, Royal Hospital, Oman. The patient also had primary amenorrhea and features of sexual infantilism. Full laboratory and radio-imaging investigations were done. Adrenal steroids, pituitary function and karyotyping study were performed and the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular mutation study. Laboratory investigations revealed adrenal steroids and pituitary hormones profile in addition to 46XY karyotype that are consistent with the diagnosis of CAH due to 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency. Extensive laboratory workup revealed low levels of serum cortisol (and its precursors 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycortisol), adrenal androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione), and estrogen (estradiol); and high levels of mineralocorticoids precursors (11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone) with high levels of ACTH, FSH and LH.

Although there are now a number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) available, approximately one-third of epilepsy patients respond poorly to drug intervention. The reasons for this are complex, but are probably reflective of the increasing number of identified mutations that predispose individuals to this disease. Thus, there is a clear requirement for the development of novel treatments to address this unmet clinical need. The existence of gene mutations that mimic a seizure-like behaviour in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, offers the possibility to exploit the powerful genetics of this insect to identify novel cellular targets to facilitate design of more effective AEDs. In this study we use neuronal expression of GCaMP, a potent calcium reporter, to image neuronal activity using a non-invasive and rapid method. Expression in motoneurons in the isolated CNS of third instar larvae shows waves of calcium-activity that pass between segments of the ventral nerve cord. Time between calcium peaks, in the same neurons, between adjacent segments usually show a temporal separation of greater than 200 ms. Exposure to proconvulsants (picrotoxin or 4-aminopyridine) reduces separation to below 200 ms showing increased synchrony of activity across adjacent segments. Increased synchrony, characteristic of epilepsy, is similarly observed in genetic seizure mutants: bangsenseless1 (bss1) and paralyticK1270T (paraK1270T). Exposure of bss1 to clinically-used antiepileptic drugs ( phenytoin or gabapentin ) significantly reduces synchrony . In this study we use the measure of synchronicity to evaluate the effectiveness of known and novel anticonvulsive compounds (antipain, isethionate, etopiside rapamycin and dipyramidole) to reduce seizure-like CNS activity. We further show that such compounds also reduce the Drosophila voltage-gated persistent Na+ current (INaP) in an identified motoneuron (aCC).

Forty patients (48%) obtained a complete hematologic and clinical remission. A history of an antecedent hematologic disorder, male sex, and absence of Auer rods were adverse factors for achieving remission in this older population.

Through a series of in vitro assays including 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, DNA fragmentation, and flow cytometric analyses, we found that gemcitabine could significantly antagonize the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel when tumor cells were exposed to the two drugs simultaneously or exposed to gemcitabine before paclitaxel.

Emphasis was placed on original studies published since 1975. ### Data Extraction Data from published research were extracted and evaluated according to study design, sample size, dosing regimen, outcome measures, and treatment efficacy and safety. ### Data Synthesis Infantile spasms constitute a rare epileptic syndrome with a poor long-term prognosis for normal intellectual development. The spasms are characterized by a brief symmetric contraction of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and/or extremities, often occurring in a series of 2 to more than 100 spasms during a single episode. The disorder is age-specific, with the peak onset of symptoms occurring between 2 and 8 months of age. Spasms of no identifiable cause in infants with normal development prior to the onset of infantile spasms are classified as cryptogenic or idiopathic, whereas those with an identifiable cause are classified as symptomatic. Long-term prognosis is best in cryptogenic cases, with 30-70 percent attaining normal intellect compared with 5-19 percent in symptomatic cases. The etiology and pathophysiology are not well understood. Recent theory postulates that infantile spasms may be caused by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone activity during infancy. The suspected association between the whole-cell pertussis vaccine and infantile spasms is coincidental. Few well-designed, prospective, controlled clinical trials for the treatment of infantile spasms have been conducted. ### conclusions Standard anticonvulsants such as phenytoin , the barbiturates , carbamazepine , and the succinimides have been ineffective . Of the anticonvulsants, only the benzodiazepines, valproic acid, and vigabatrin have shown efficacy in reducing spasm frequency and severity. Hormonal therapy with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and/or prednisone has been the most frequently studied treatment modality and appears to be the most effective. Hormonal therapy achieves complete spasm control in 50-75 percent of infants within four weeks of initiation. Opinions differ regarding the relative efficacy between ACTH and prednisone, the need for early initiation of hormonal treatment, and the benefits of high dosages of ACTH (> 40 units/d). No treatment has been shown conclusively to improve the long-term intellectual development of these infants. Neurosurgery may be the treatment of choice in select cases when a localized central nervous system abnormality can be demonstrated. Well-designed, blind, prospective clinical trials are needed to answer definitively many lingering questions regarding the treatment of infantile spasms.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7919570/"}

Insensitivity towards anthracycline drugs like doxorubicin poses a significant challenge in the treatment of breast cancer. Among several factors, Aurora A (a mitotic serine threonine kinase) plays crucial roles in acquiring non-responsiveness towards doxorubicin. However, the mechanisms underlying need to be elucidated. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of Aurora A mediated doxorubicin insensitivity in MCF-7Dox/R, an isolated resistant-subline of MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma cell line). Effect of curcumin, a natural phytochemical in restoring doxorubicin sensitivity by targeting Aurora A was assessed furthermore. ### methods A doxorubicin resistant subline (MCF-7Dox/R) was isolated from the parental MCF-7 cells by treating the cell with gradual step-wise increasing concentration of the drug. Expressions of Aurora A and its target proteins (Akt, I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF\u03baB) were assessed in both parental and MCF-7Dox/R cells. Both the cell lines were pretreated with curcumin prior to doxorubicin treatment. Cellular proliferation rate was measured using BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) assay kit. Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation was estimated spectrofluorimetrically. Cellular uptake of curcumin (spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric method) and its nuclear localization was confirmed by confocal microscopic study. Protein expressions were determined by western blot analysis. Localization of Aurora A was ascertained by immunofluorescence assay. To explore the possible outcome of impact of curcumin on Aurora A, cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis were performed subsequently. ### results Higher expressions of Aurora A in MCF-7Dox/R cells led to phosphorylation of Akt as well as I\u03baB\u03b1.

After a minimum of 9 doses and adequate clinical improvement (relative to before the start of IV study drug, decreased body temperature and white blood cell count, improved or absent signs and symptoms of cIAI, and return of normal bowel function), patients could be switched to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate. Antibacterial therapy (IV plus subsequent oral) was given for a total of 5 to 14 days. The coprimary efficacy end points were the clinical cure rate (complete resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms of the index infection) in patients microbiologically evaluable (>or=1 baseline pathogen isolated from an intra-abdominal culture that was susceptible to both IV study drug therapies) at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (21-60 days after the completion of study drug therapy) and the clinical cure rate in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population (a bacterial pathogen identified at baseline, regardless of its susceptibility to the study drug).

IrAEs typically originate in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and endocrine system, although other organ systems may also be affected. This article provides an overview of irAEs associated with anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) as monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibition (ipilimumab), followed by a discussion of irAEs of special clinical interest based on the potential for morbidity, frequent steroid use, and inpatient admission.

The aim of this study is to compare the effect of cimetidine, l-carnitine and both agents together on mARF in rats. Forty rats were divided into 5 groups; group I: control rats, group II: myoglobinuric ARF rats, group III: mARF rats received l-carnitine (200mg/kg, i.p.), group IV: mARF rats received cimetidine (150mg/kg i.p.) and group V: mARF rats received both agents together. 48h after glycerol injection, systolic blood pressure was measured. Urine and blood samples were collected to evaluate urine volume, GFR, BUN, creatinine, K, Na, serum creatine kinase, NO and glutathione levels. Kidney specimens were taken to investigate renal cytochrome p450 and for histological examinations. cimetidine treatment significantly decreased creatinine, BUN, K, Na, SBP and creatine kinase and increased GFR and urine volume compared to group II. l-carnitine exerted similar changes except for the effect on K and GFR. NO was significantly decreased, while renal glutathione and cytochrome p450 were significantly increased in groups treated with l-carnitine or cimetidine as compared to group II. Combined treatment further improved renal functions, creatine kinase, oxidative stress parameters and SBP as compared to each therapy alone. The histological changes confirmed the biochemical findings. cimetidine and l-carnitine have protective effects - almost equally - against mARF.

Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Roche). Genotypic resistance was measured by sequencing the reverse transcriptase gene from plasma HIV-1 RNA. Phenotypic resistance was measured using a recombinant assay (Virco). ### results Patients were treated with a combination including zidovudine for a mean (+/- SEM) period of 21.8 +/- 3.5 months and had a plasma viral load of 4.1 +/- 0.2 log HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (time 1). After a mean period of 19.3 +/- 1.6 months following the therapeutic change, the plasma viral load was 3.6 +/- 0.1 log copies/mL (time 2).

This study's objective was to determine the prevalence of body shape changes and metabolic abnormalities in an ambulant population with HIV infection. Three different definitions of lipodystrophy were used to assess these changes. Patients' anthropometric measures and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were compared in order to estimate fat distribution in this population. We sought to evaluate potential predictors for lipodystrophy according to each of the three definitions. ### methods We performed a cross-sectional study in the outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne, Australia. We enrolled a total of 167 HIV-infected ambulatory patients over 3 months in mid-1998. Data on 159 males, 149 of whom were receiving triple combination antiretroviral therapy, were evaluated. Anthropometric measures, clinical examination, self-report of body shape changes, biochemical measures and DEXA scan were used to assess lipodystrophy and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients described body shape changes in the face, trunk, arms and legs. Laboratory parameters measured included fasting triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), glucose, insulin, CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA. Current and past antiretroviral therapies were ascertained. ### results According to one proposed Australian national definition of lipodystrophy (LDNC), the prevalence of lipodystrophy in this population was 65%. This definition included an objective assessment with major and minor criteria. Patient-defined lipodystrophy (LDP), which involved a subjective assessment of thinning arms and legs and central adiposity, occurred in 19%. Patient-defined lipoatrophy (LAP), which involved a subjective assessment of thinning arms and legs without central adiposity, occurred in 21.3%. No change in body habitus was noted by 37% of the cohort. Hypercholesterolaemia was recorded in 44%, hypertriglyceridaemia in 52% and elevated insulin levels in 23%. Anthropometry was predictive of the per cent total body fat recorded by DEXA scan, but produced consistently lower values. In multivariate analysis , LDP and LAP were significantly associated with stavudine ( d4 T ) use , while LAP was also associated with zidovudine ( ZDV ) treatment . There were no treatment associations with LDNC. Protease inhibitor (PI) exposure was associated with metabolic changes but not patient perceived body shape changes, while d4T and ZDV exposure was associated with increased triglycerides and reduced peripheral fat stores. ### conclusions The prevalence of body shape changes in a single population varied depending on the definition applied. The LDNC definition overestimated body shape abnormalities in comparison with patient perception. LAP was associated with significantly lower fat stores measured by anthropometry and DEXA scan than those identified under the LDNC definition. In contrast to LDNC, LAP was associated with d4T exposure, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and ZDV duration of use, but not PI use. Until a consensus definition for lipodystrophy is developed, including agreement on objective measurement and thresholds for abnormality, careful description of the individual components of the syndrome is required to enable cohort comparisons so that predictors of the syndrome can be assessed more accurately and outcome studies made feasible.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11737398/"}

Identification of CYP3A4 as the major isoform responsible for colchicine demethylation. colchicine disposition involves both active biliary and renal excretion of parent drug, and at least in mammals a substantial fraction undergoes hepatic demethylation prior to excretion. We investigated the biotransformation of [3H]colchicine in a panel of microsomal preparations obtained from sixteen human liver samples. The production rate of the main metabolites of colchicine's 3-demethylcolchicine (3DMC) and 2-demethylcolchicine (2DMC), was linear in relation to incubation time, cytochrome (P450) content, and substrate concentration. Following the incubation of colchicine (5 nM) with microsomes in the presence of an NADPH-generating system for 60 min, 9.8% and 5.5% of the substrate were metabolized to 3DMC and 2DMC, respectively. The formation rate of colchicine metabolites exhibited a marked variation between the different microsomal preparations. The formation rates of both colchicine metabolites were correlated significantly with nifedipine oxidase activity, a marker of CYP3A4 activity (r = 0.96, P < 0.001), but not with the metabolic markers of CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 activities. Chemical inhibition of CYP3A4 by preincubation with gestodene (40 microM) or troleandomycin (40 microM) reduced the formation of 3DMC and 2DMC by 70 and 80%, respectively, whereas quinidine, diethyldithiocarbamate, and sulfaphenazole had no inhibitory effect. Similarly , antibodies raised against CYP3A4 almost completely abolished colchicine demethylation and nifedipine oxidase activity , but preimmune IgG had no effect . In conclusion, colchicine was metabolized to 3DMC and 2DMC by human liver microsomes.

Furthermore , our group has shown that the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective in anthracycline-resistant ABC . ### Patients And Methods From January 1996 until March 1997, 66 women with ABC were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) by three-hour infusion followed by carboplatin at an AUC of 6 mg x min/ml every three weeks. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 28-75). A total of 39 patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy and 22 of them were treated with an anthracycline or mitoxantrone-containing regimen. ### results A total of 324 cycles (median: six) were administered, 273 (85%) of them at full dose. The median number of delivered cycles was six. The median delivered dose intensity (DI) of paclitaxel was 55.1 mg/m2/week (range 30.5-69.3) and the relative DI was 0.95 (range 0.5-1.2). Eight patients (12%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5%-22%) achieved complete and 28 (42%, 95% CI: 30%-55%) partial responses. Grade 3-4 toxicities included anemia (5%), granulocytopenia (24%), thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting and allergic reaction (3% each), myalgias/arthralgias and neurotoxicity (1.5% each).

We assessed the efficacy and safety of further bevacizumab therapy in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed after treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. ### methods In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients who had HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after receiving 12 weeks or more of first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy from 118 centres in 12 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a central interactive voice response system using a block randomisation schedule (block size four) stratified by hormone receptor status, first-line progression-free survival, selected chemotherapy, and lactate dehydrogenase concentration, to receive second-line single-agent chemotherapy either alone or with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Second-line therapy was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. At progression, patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone received third-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab; those randomly assigned to bevacizumab continued bevacizumab with third-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from randomisation to second-line progression or death in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is ongoing, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01250379. ### findings Between Feb 17, 2011, and April 3, 2013, 494 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (247 in each group). The median duration of follow-up at the time of this prespecified primary progression-free survival analysis was 15\u00b79 months (IQR 9\u00b71-21\u00b77) in the chemotherapy-alone group and 16\u00b71 months (10\u00b76-22\u00b77) in the combination group.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of melatonin on the genotoxic activity of irinotecan in healthy human lymphocytes and a lung cancer cell line (A549) and a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT29) in vitro. irinotecan, as a single agent, was shown to induce DNA damage in all types of analyzed cells.

We compared the benefits of a single cycle of high-dose chemotherapy and the benefits of conventional chemotherapy in patients with high-risk breast cancer in a prospective, unblinded, randomized trial. ### methods Between February 23, 1995, and June 29, 1999, 605 patients with breast cancer who had four or more positive lymph nodes were randomly assigned to treatment (307 to high-dose therapy and 298 to conventional therapy). The conventional chemotherapy regimen was four cycles of doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) followed by eight cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide [600 mg/m2], methotrexate [50 mg/m2], and 5-fluorouracil [600 mg/m2]), all given intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The high-dose regimen was four cycles of doxorubicin (75 mg/m2), followed by a single cycle of intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide (4000 mg/m2) supported by filgrastim (300 microg/day) for up to 10 days followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide (6000 mg/m2) and thiotepa (800 mg/m2).

The combination of paclitaxel and doxorubicin yielded response rates between 63% and 93% in phase I/II studies. In these studies, however, the investigators reported severe cardiac toxic events. The rationale for the current study was therefore to evaluate the combination of paclitaxel/epirubicin, focusing mainly on cardiac toxicity. In two groups, 85 patients with metastatic breast cancer entered the study. Approximately 20% of the patients had primary metastatic breast cancer with large tumors at the primary site. Half of the patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy. Study medication in group A consisted of epirubicin 60 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 hour, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour intravenous infusion after premedication with steroids, antihistamines, and H2-blockers. In group B , epirubicin 90 mg/m2 was combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 , given in the same manner as in group A. Dose escalation to 225 mg/m2 paclitaxel was planned in both groups. The main toxicity in both groups was neutropenia (73% World Health Organization grade 3/4 in group A and 93% in group B). Other hematologic side effects were rare. No febrile neutropenia was reported in group A, but two episodes occurred in group B. Peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia, and myalgia were mild (only World Health Organization grades 1 and 2). Alopecia was universal. In group A, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in 15 patients and to 225 mg/m2 in seven patients. Dose reduction due to severe neutropenia was necessary in 11 patients. No cardiac events were reported in group A. In group B, the paclitaxel dose could be escalated to 200 mg/m2 in only one patient, and no patient reached 225 mg/m2. Three patients needed a dose reduction. In this group, one patient had a greater than 10% decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction with no clinical signs. In group A, 43 patients were evaluable for response; in group B, 25 patients were evaluable. Thirteen patients were out of protocol with only bone metastasis, and two patients had more than one prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The response rate was identical in both groups, with five complete remissions and 24 partial remissions in group A and three complete responses and 14 partial remissions in group B. The duration of response was 8.2 months in both groups. The median cumulative epirubicin dose was 420 mg/m2 in group A and 630 mg/m2 in group B. The combination of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and epirubicin 60 or 90 mg/m2 can be administered safely to patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Several human cancers express SSTRs, including prostate cancer, and therefore SMS is of interest for anti-cancer therapy. DNA methylation and histone modifications are involved in normal cell development, gene imprinting and human carcinogenesis. Reversing DNA methylation is an attractive therapeutic possibility, since epigenetic modifications change gene expression without changing the gene function. DNA methylation inhibitors such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'-aza, decitabine) have been used to treat several types of haematological malignancies. Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin (TSA), are a new class of 'targeted anti-cancer agents'. TSA and decitabine can induce growth arrest, apoptosis or terminal differentiation in a variety of solid and haematological cancers in advanced disease patients. In the present study, the LNCaP cell line (prostate cancer) was incubated with SMS or Somadex (an SMS polymer conjugate) for three days, 1 nM per day, and the untreated cells were the negative control. For DNA demethylation, cells were grown in the presence of 2.5 microM 5-aza for 120 h, and re-fed with 5-aza-containing fresh medium at day 3. The total incubation time with 5-aza was 120 h. TSA at 1.0 microM was added into the cultured cells for 24 h. The combined treatment of 5-aza and TSA was performed by incubating the cells with 5-aza for 120 h followed by a 24-h exposure to TSA. Using cDNA obtained from these cell lines, the difference in the expression level of SSTR mRNA transcripts before and after 5-aza and TSA treatments was analyzed by RT-PCR. An increased induction of mRNA expression of the five SSTR subtypes was observed in the LNCaP cells when incubated with SMS/Somadex (dose-dependent). The inhibition of DNA methylation and histone acetylation resulted in the up-regulation of SSTR5 mRNA expression. The results demonstrate a positive feedback loop between SMS and its receptors. This regulation pathway may enhance the anti-tumor activity of somatostatin. To benefit from this effect in a clinical setting, the dose, dose frequency and pan affinity of the SMS derivative are important factors. The epigenetic manipulation with DNA methylation or histone deacetylase inhibitors, combined with SMS, may offer a novel alternative for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18575731/"}

Furthermore, given in repeated oral doses, charcoal increases, to some extent, the rate of elimination of amitriptyline and nortriptyline, probably by interrupting their enterohepatic or enteroenteric circulation.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3015809/"}

Method: A database (MALPRO2) on travelers on their flight home from Africa to Europe between July 1988 and December 1991 was reanalyzed. It contains data on prophylaxis with mefloquine ( n = 48,264 ) , with chloroquine ( 6,752 ) , with chloroquine plus proguanil ( 19,727 ) , and with no prophylaxis ( 3,871 ) . The comparison of rates of malaria incidence and adverse events (AEs) between users and nonusers of co-medication was expressed by relative risk (RR). Results: Fifty-three percent of travelers (63% of females, 43% of males) used co-medication in all prophylaxis groups, with an average of 1.35 additional drugs per person and about two AEs reported per person. With the exception of antidiarrheals plus mefloquine, malaria incidence with co-medication was lower (RR = 0.8) than without co-medication. In all regimens, the proportion of travelers reporting AEs was about 1.5-fold with co-medication (p<.01); that reporting severe AEs was twice as high as compared to with no co-medication. mefloquine AE rates for various classes of co-medication were similar to that of chloroquine, with highest AE and severity rates with neuropsychiatric drugs (excluding antiepileptics, RR = 1.9 and 2.9), and lowest rates with cardiovasculars (RR = 1.1 and 1.0). Various co-medications were used with different frequencies in males and females, and the latter reported more AEs.

We hypothesized that the brain damage mitigating effect of mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest can be enhanced with thiopental loading , and even more so with the further addition of phenytoin and methylprednisolone . Twenty-four dogs (four groups of six dogs each) received VF 12.5 min no-flow, reversed with brief cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), controlled ventilation to 20 h, and intensive care to 96 h. Group 1 with normothermia throughout and randomized group 2 with mild hypothermia (from reperfusion to 2 h) were controls. Then, group 3 received in addition, thiopental 90 mg/kg i.v. over the first 6 h. Then, group 4 received, in addition to group 2 treatment, thiopental 30 mg/kg i.v. over the first 90 min (because the larger dose had produced cardiopulmonary complications), plus phenytoin 15 mg/kg i.v. at 15 min after reperfusion, and methylprednisolone 130 mg/kg i.v. over 20 h. All dogs survived. Best overall performance categories (OPC) achieved (OPC 1 = normal, OPC 5 = brain death) were better in group 2 than group 1 (< 0.05) and numerically better in groups 3 or 4 than in groups 1 or 2. Good cerebral outcome (OPC 1 or 2) was achieved by all six dogs only in group 4 (P < 0.05 group 4 vs. 2).

Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable tumor due to the high rate of relapse that still occurs. Acquired drug resistance represents the most challenging obstacle to the extension of survival and several studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms of this phenomenon. Mitochondrial pathways have been extensively investigated, demonstrating that cancer cells become resistant to drugs by reprogramming their metabolic assessment. MM cells acquire resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs), activating protection programs, such as a reduction in oxidative stress, down-regulating pro-apoptotic, and up-regulating anti-apoptotic signals. Knowledge of the mechanisms through which tumor cells escape control of the immune system and acquire resistance to drugs has led to the creation of new compounds that can restore the response by leading to cell death.

We sought to evaluate the clinical activity of enzalutamide versus docetaxel in men with mCRPC who progressed on abiraterone. ### methods We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of consecutive mCRPC patients who had progressed on abiraterone therapy and subsequently received either enzalutamide (n=30) or docetaxel (n=31). We evaluated clinical outcomes including prostate-specific antigen decline of >30% (PSA30) or >50% (PSA50), PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and clinical/radiographic PFS. We performed multivariable modeling to control for baseline and on-treatment differences between groups. ### results Compared to subjects who received enzalutamide post-abiraterone, subjects who received docetaxel post-abiraterone had more bone metastases, more visceral metastases, higher baseline PSA, and had more frequent PSA tests while on-treatment. There were no significant differences in PSA30 (41% for enzalutamide vs. 53% for docetaxel) or PSA50 (34% vs. 40%) response rates between the two groups; there remained no difference after stratifying by presence/absence of prior response to abiraterone.

Systemic vasculitis is classified as primary (eg, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome) or secondary, the latter associated with connective tissue disorders, infections, medications, and rarely, as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Neuropathy is a common complication of systemic vasculitis and is related to ischemic nerve fiber damage with axon loss. Peripheral neuropathy may be the sole manifestation of vasculitis, a condition termed nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Treatment of vasculitic neuropathy requires long-term immunosuppressive therapies with potential side effects. The diagnosis of vasculitis should be established by tissue (preferably nerve) biopsy. High-dose prednisone is the standard platform therapy for patients with systemic and NSVN; for those with systemic vasculitis, at least 3 to 12 months of treatment with cyclophosphamide (monthly intravenous pulse or daily oral therapy) is also necessary to sustain remission and allow successful prednisone tapering. The use of cyclophosphamide in patients with NSVN is controversial , but recent retrospective data suggest that those treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide from the outset fare better than those initially treated only with prednisone . If prednisone is administered as monotherapy, cyclophosphamide should be added after several months if there is no improvement or relapse occurs with tapering of prednisone.

This study aimed to determine if dual therapy with cediranib and the oral EGFR inhibitor gefitinib improved outcome in recurrent glioblastoma. ### Methods And Findings This was a multi-center randomized , two-armed , double-blinded phase II study comparing cediranib plus gefitinib versus cediranib plus placebo in subjects with first relapse/first progression of glioblastoma following surgery and chemoradiotherapy . The primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and radiologic response rate. Recruitment was terminated early following suspension of the cediranib program. 38 subjects (112 planned) were enrolled with 19 subjects in each treatment arm. Median PFS with cediranib plus gefitinib was 3.6 months compared to 2.8 months for cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.72, 90% CI; 0.41 to 1.26). Median OS was 7.2 months with cediranib plus gefitinib and 5.5 months with cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.68, 90% CI; 0.39 to 1.19). Eight subjects (42%) had a partial response in the cediranib plus gefitinib arm versus five patients (26%) in the cediranib plus placebo arm. ### conclusions cediranib and gefitinib in combination is tolerated in patients with glioblastoma. Incomplete recruitment led to the study being underpowered. However, a trend towards improved survival and response rates with the addition of gefitinib to cediranib was observed. Further studies of the combination incorporating EGFR and VEGF inhibition are warranted. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01310855.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27232884/"}

However, the overall efficacies of TKIs are limited due to the development of drug resistance. Therefore, it is important to elucidate mechanisms of EGFR and c-Met TKI resistance in order to develop more effective therapies. Model NSCLC cell lines H1975 and H2170 were used to study the similarities and differences in mechanisms of EGFR/c-Met TKI resistance. H1975 cells are positive for the T790M EGFR mutation, which confers resistance to current EGFR TKI therapies, while H2170 cells are EGFR wild-type. Previously, H2170 cells were made resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib and the c-Met TKI SU11274 by exposure to progressively increasing concentrations of TKIs. In H2170 and H1975 TKI-resistant cells, key Wnt and mTOR proteins were found to be differentially modulated. Wnt signaling transducer, active \u03b2-catenin was upregulated in TKI-resistant H2170 cells when compared to parental cells. GATA-6, a transcriptional activator of Wnt, was also found to be upregulated in resistant H2170 cells. In H2170 erlotinib resistant cells, upregulation of inactive GSK3\u03b2 (p-GSK3\u03b2) was observed, indicating activation of Wnt and mTOR pathways which are otherwise inhibited by its active form. However, in H1975 cells, Wnt modulators such as active \u03b2-catenin, GATA-6 and p-GSK3\u03b2 were downregulated. Additional results from MTT cell viability assays demonstrated that H1975 cell proliferation was not significantly decreased after Wnt inhibition by XAV939 , but combination treatment with everolimus ( mTOR inhibitor ) and erlotinib resulted in synergistic cell growth inhibition . Thus, in H2170 cells and H1975 cells, simultaneous inhibition of key Wnt or mTOR pathway proteins in addition to EGFR and c-Met may be a promising strategy for overcoming EGFR and c-Met TKI resistance in NSCLC patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26301867/"}

This report reviews the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab, agents that inhibit tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), when used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. ### Data Sources Electronic databases were searched up to February 2005. ### Review Methods Systematic reviews of the literature on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were undertaken and industry submissions to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) were reviewed. Meta-analyses of effectiveness data were also undertaken for each agent. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), a simulation model, was further developed and used to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. ### results Twenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of high quality, were included. The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (<or=3 years) who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage . etanercept was also marginally more effective and better tolerated than methotrexate in patients with longer disease durations who had not failed methotrexate treatment. infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate. All three agents, either alone (where so licensed) or in combination with ongoing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were effective in reducing the symptoms and signs of RA in patients with established disease. At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections. All ten published economic evaluations met standard criteria for quality, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from being within established thresholds to being very high because of varying assumptions and parameters. All three sponsors who submitted economic models made assumptions favourable to their product. BRAM incorporates improvements in quality of life and mortality, but assumes no effect of TNF inhibitors on joint replacement. For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and pound50,000 per QALY in late RA. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to the estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on TNF inhibitors and the effectiveness of DMARDs, but not to changes in mortality ratios per unit HAQ. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used last. The ICER for etanercept used last is pound24,000 per QALY, substantially lower than for adalimumab ( pound30,000 per QALY) or infliximab ( pound38,000 per QALY). First line use as monotherapy generates ICERs around pound50,000 per QALY for adalimumab and etanercept. Using the combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor as first line treatment generates much higher ICERs, as it precludes subsequent use of methotrexate, which is cheap. The ICERs for sequential use are of the same order as using the TNF inhibitor alone. ### conclusions adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints. The combination of a TNF inhibitor with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone in early RA, although the clinical relevance of this additional benefit is yet to be established, particularly in view of the well-established effectiveness of MTX alone. An increased risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out for the combination of methotrexate with adalimumab or infliximab. The results of the economic evaluation based on BRAM are consistent with the observations from the review of clinical effectiveness, including the ranking of treatments. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used as last active therapy. In this analysis, other things being equal, etanercept may be the TNF inhibitor of choice, although this may also depend on patient preference as to route of administration. The next most cost-effective use of TNF inhibitors is third line, as recommended in the 2002 NICE guidance. Direct comparative RCTs of TNF inhibitors against each other and against other DMARDs, and sequential use in patients who have failed a previous TNF inhibitor, are needed. Longer term studies of the quality of life in patients with RA and the impact of DMARDs on this are needed, as are longer studies that directly assess effects on joint replacement, other morbidity and mortality.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17049139/"}

The treatment paradigm of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed rapidly in recent years. In first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk patients , the CheckMate 214 study demonstrated a significant survival advantage for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib . The high cost of combined immune-modulating agents warrants an understanding of the combination's value by considering both efficacy and cost. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab compared with sunitinib for first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC from the U.S. payer perspective. ### Materials And Methods A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab with those of sunitinib in the first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates in 2017. We extrapolated survival beyond the trial closure using Weibull distribution. Model robustness was addressed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. ### results The total mean cost per-patient of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib was $292,308 and $169,287, respectfully. nivolumab and ipilimumab generated a gain of 0.978 QALYs over sunitinib. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for nivolumab and ipilimumab was $125,739/QALY versus sunitinib. ### conclusion Our analysis established that the base case ICER in the model for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib is below what some would consider the upper limit of the theoretical willingness-to-pay threshold in the U.S. ($150,000/QALY) and is thus estimated to be cost-effective. ### Implications For Practice This article assessed the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib for treatment of patients with intermediate- to poor-risk metastatic kidney cancer, from the U.S. payer perspective. It would cost $125,739 to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib in these patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30710066/"}

Taxanes are one of the most powerful classes of compounds among all chemotherapeutic drugs. Only 30 years separate the isolation of the first taxane from the results of direct clinical comparisons in metastatic breast, ovarian, and lung cancer between the two taxanes available in routine clinical practice. These results suggest a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio for docetaxel compared to paclitaxel when these drugs are used as single agents or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in an every-3-week dosing regimen. Pharmacological data support the difference between the taxanes, likely explaining the clinical results. Considering the molecular pharmacology of the two drugs, docetaxel appears to bind to beta-tubulin with greater affinity and has a wider cell cycle activity than paclitaxel. docetaxel also appears to have direct antitumoral activity via an apoptotic effect mediated by bcl-2 phosphorylation. In addition , docetaxel has a longer retention time in tumor cells than paclitaxel because of greater uptake and slower efflux . Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the taxanes show both agents to be extensively metabolized in the liver, and paclitaxel has a nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior while docetaxel has linear pharmacokinetics. These differences explain the more simple treatment schedule and favorable results for docetaxel as a single agent and in combination therapy. Last, but not least, there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between paclitaxel and the anthracyclines, an active class of compounds commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. This pharmacokinetic interaction is associated with greater cardio- and myelotoxicities, which are sequence dependent. These pharmacological data likely explain the different clinical development strategies for the two molecules as well as the different clinical results from individual trials and direct comparisons.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15161985/"}

Breast cancer is associated with high levels of incidence, morbidity and mortality; therefore, the identification of effective chemopreventive strategies is crucial. It is important for clinicians to be able to identify the populations at risk who would benefit from chemoprevention, and the interventions that are effective and safe. The aim of the present study was to investigate the combined effects of simvastatin and exemestane on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells . The anti-proliferative effects of simvastatin and exemestane, alone and in combination, on the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were assessed by MTT assay. The synergism between the two drugs was determined in vitro using the combination index (CI) analysis. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, and alterations to the signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells were examined by immunoblotting following treatment with various regimens. The results of the MTT assay indicated that the combined treatment of simvastatin and exemestane significantly decreased the viability of MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human breast cancer cells, as compared with those that were treated with the individual drugs (CI<1). In addition, coadministration of exemestane and simvastatin was shown to result in marked inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, significant cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis, as compared with that of the control and individual drug-treated cells. Furthermore, the results of the present study indicated that these synergistic effects may be associated with the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein apoptotic pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6 kinase growth pathway. The combination of exemestane and simvastatin generated synergistic effects on MCF-7 ER+ breast cancer cells, indicating that the combination of these drugs may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The combination of the two inhibitors markedly increased the efficacy, as compared with the single-agent treatment, suggesting that combination treatment could become a highly effective approach for breast cancer. The results of the present study suggested that this combination of drugs has therapeutic potential, and requires further mechanistic and biomarker investigations in clinical trials.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25738757/"}

Treatment and morbidity control of schistosomiasis relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), and the selection of resistant worms under repeated treatment is a concern. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. ### methodology We used a custom-designed Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro assay. ### Principal Findings We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP1A2 gene product, was chosen and tested. Sublethal doses of PZQ combined with OMP significantly increased worm mortality in vitro when compared with PZQ or OMP alone, thus evidencing a synergistic effect. ### conclusions Functional analysis of gene interaction networks is an important approach that can point to possible novel synergistic drug candidates. We demonstrated the potential of this strategy by showing that PZQ in combination with OMP displayed increased efficiency against S. mansoni adult worms in vitro when compared with either drug alone.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26402251/"}
