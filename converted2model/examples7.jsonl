Current treatment guidelines prefer the longer-acting agent, palonosetron, for CINV prevention in some chemotherapy regimens. A new granisetron formulation, APF530, has been developed as an alternative long-acting agent. APF530 utilizes Biochronomer(\u2122) technology to formulate a viscous tri(ethylene glycol) poly(orthoester)-based formulation that delivers - by single subcutaneous (SC) injection - therapeutic granisetron concentrations over 5 days. The poly(orthoester) polymer family contain an orthoester linkage; these bioerodible polymer systems are specifically designed for controlled, sustained drug delivery. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of APF530 250, 500, or 750 mg SC (granisetron 5, 10, or 15 mg, respectively) administered 30-60 minutes before chemotherapy were evaluated in two Phase II trials in cancer patients receiving moderately (MEC) or highly (HEC) emetogenic chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetics were dose proportional, with slow granisetron absorption and elimination. Both trials demonstrated similar results for median half-life, time to maximum concentration, and exposure for APF530 250 and 500 mg, with no differences between patients receiving MEC or HEC. A randomized Phase III trial demonstrated noninferiority of APF530 500 mg SC ( granisetron 10 mg ) to intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg in preventing CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC in acute ( 0 - 24 hours ) and delayed ( 24 - 120 hours ) settings , with activity over 120 hours .

Therapeutic granisetron concentrations were maintained for greater than 120 hours (5 days) in both APF530 dose groups.

Inflammation is characteristic of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. These include Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, all of the tauopathies, multiple sclerosis and many other less common conditions. Morphologically, the level of inflammation is determined by the concentration and degree of activation of microglial cells. Biochemically, it is judged by the presence of a spectrum of inflammatory mediators. Epidemiological evidence indicates that anti-inflammatory agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have a sparing effect on AD and PD indicating that inflammation exacerbates the pathology in these diseases. NSAIDs are protective in transgenic animal models of AD, providing further evidence of the negative consequences of inflammation. Here we describe an in vitro model, which was used to study the protective effects of NSAIDs in AD. This model is based on neuronal cell killing by stimulated microglia or microglia-like cells. In this model NSAIDs show protective effects at a therapeutically relevant level, which is in the low micromolar range. There are reports suggesting that NSAIDs act independently of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition, but only at higher doses. Classical NSAIDs are still the most logical choice for agents that will slow the progression or delay the onset of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases despite failures of naproxen , celecoxib and rofecoxib in AD clinical trials .

As PPI metabolism also involves CYP2C19, it was hypothesized that competition by PPIs might interfere with clopidogrel's action. omeprazole, but not other PPIs, worsens surrogate markers of clopidogrel efficacy. Some (but not all) observational studies show that clopidogrel users prescribed PPIs have increased risks of CV events (hazard/odds ratios=1.25-1.5). When effect sizes are small to moderate (relative risks<1.5-2.0), however, it is only possible to conclude whether statistical associations are valid in randomized trials. A randomized trial of omeprazole vs. placebo in clopidogrel users showed no difference in CV events (hazard ratio=1.02,0.70-1.51). Thus, current evidence does not justify a conclusion that PPIs are associated with CV events among clopidogrel users, let alone a judgment of causality.

Resistance is a significant limitation to the effectiveness of cancer therapies. The PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways play important roles in a variety of normal cellular processes and tumorigenesis. This study is designed to explore the relationship of these signaling pathways with multidrug resistance in prostate cancer (PCa). The PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways were investigated utilizing paclitaxel resistant DU145-TxR PCa cells and their parental non-resistant DU145 cells to determine their relationship with resistance to paclitaxel and other anticancer drugs. Our results demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways are upregulated in DU145-TxR cells compared to the DU145 cells. Inactivating these pathways using the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 or the MAP kinase pathway inhibitor PD98059 renders the DU145-TxR cells more sensitive to paclitaxel. We investigated the effects of these inhibitors on other anticancer drugs including docetaxel , vinblastine , doxorubicin , 10-Hydroxycamptothecin ( 10-HCPT ) and cisplatin and find that both inhibitors induces DU145-TxR cells to be more sensitive only to the microtubule-targeting drugs ( paclitaxel , docetaxel and vinblastine ) . Furthermore, the treatment with these inhibitors induces cleaved-PARP production in DU145-TxR cells, suggesting that apoptosis induction might be one of the mechanisms for the reversal of drug resistance. In conclusion, the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways are associated with resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. Inactivating these pathways renders these PCa cells more sensitive to microtubule-targeting drugs such as paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinblastine.

Patients were treated with weekly trastuzumab followed by intravenous tanespimycin, assessed in escalating dose levels. ### results Twenty-five patients were enrolled onto four tanespimycin dose levels: 225 (n = 4), 300 (n = 3), 375 (n = 8), and 450 mg/m2 (n = 10). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed at the third and fourth cohort (1 patient each): more than 2-week delay for grade 4 fatigue/grade 2 nausea and anorexia (375 mg/m2); more than 2-week delay for thrombocytopenia (450 mg/m2).

Background: To determine the relevance of drug interactions with co-medication for effectiveness and tolerability of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Method: A database (MALPRO2) on travelers on their flight home from Africa to Europe between July 1988 and December 1991 was reanalyzed. It contains data on prophylaxis with mefloquine ( n = 48,264 ) , with chloroquine ( 6,752 ) , with chloroquine plus proguanil ( 19,727 ) , and with no prophylaxis ( 3,871 ) . The comparison of rates of malaria incidence and adverse events (AEs) between users and nonusers of co-medication was expressed by relative risk (RR). Results: Fifty-three percent of travelers (63% of females, 43% of males) used co-medication in all prophylaxis groups, with an average of 1.35 additional drugs per person and about two AEs reported per person. With the exception of antidiarrheals plus mefloquine, malaria incidence with co-medication was lower (RR = 0.8) than without co-medication. In all regimens, the proportion of travelers reporting AEs was about 1.5-fold with co-medication (p<.01); that reporting severe AEs was twice as high as compared to with no co-medication. mefloquine AE rates for various classes of co-medication were similar to that of chloroquine, with highest AE and severity rates with neuropsychiatric drugs (excluding antiepileptics, RR = 1.9 and 2.9), and lowest rates with cardiovasculars (RR = 1.1 and 1.0). Various co-medications were used with different frequencies in males and females, and the latter reported more AEs. Conclusion: These data suggest that co-medications commonly used by travelers have no significant clinical impact on safety and effectiveness of prophylaxis with mefloquine or chloroquine. Increased frequency and severity of AEs when using co-medication rather is explained by underlying illness.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9815496/"}

We hypothesized that the brain damage mitigating effect of mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest can be enhanced with thiopental loading , and even more so with the further addition of phenytoin and methylprednisolone . Twenty-four dogs (four groups of six dogs each) received VF 12.5 min no-flow, reversed with brief cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), controlled ventilation to 20 h, and intensive care to 96 h. Group 1 with normothermia throughout and randomized group 2 with mild hypothermia (from reperfusion to 2 h) were controls. Then, group 3 received in addition, thiopental 90 mg/kg i.v. over the first 6 h. Then, group 4 received, in addition to group 2 treatment, thiopental 30 mg/kg i.v. over the first 90 min (because the larger dose had produced cardiopulmonary complications), plus phenytoin 15 mg/kg i.v. at 15 min after reperfusion, and methylprednisolone 130 mg/kg i.v. over 20 h. All dogs survived. Best overall performance categories (OPC) achieved (OPC 1 = normal, OPC 5 = brain death) were better in group 2 than group 1 (< 0.05) and numerically better in groups 3 or 4 than in groups 1 or 2. Good cerebral outcome (OPC 1 or 2) was achieved by all six dogs only in group 4 (P < 0.05 group 4 vs. 2). Best NDS were 44 +/- 3% in group 1; 20 +/- 14% in group 2 (P = 0.002); 21 +/- 15% in group 3 (NS vs. group 2); and 7 +/- 8% in group 4 (P = 0.08 vs. group 2).

Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable tumor due to the high rate of relapse that still occurs. Acquired drug resistance represents the most challenging obstacle to the extension of survival and several studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms of this phenomenon. Mitochondrial pathways have been extensively investigated, demonstrating that cancer cells become resistant to drugs by reprogramming their metabolic assessment. MM cells acquire resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs), activating protection programs, such as a reduction in oxidative stress, down-regulating pro-apoptotic, and up-regulating anti-apoptotic signals. Knowledge of the mechanisms through which tumor cells escape control of the immune system and acquire resistance to drugs has led to the creation of new compounds that can restore the response by leading to cell death. In this scenario, based on all literature data available, our review represents the first collection of anti-mitochondrial compounds able to overcome drug resistance in MM.

We evaluated clinical outcomes including prostate-specific antigen decline of >30% (PSA30) or >50% (PSA50), PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and clinical/radiographic PFS. We performed multivariable modeling to control for baseline and on-treatment differences between groups. ### results Compared to subjects who received enzalutamide post-abiraterone, subjects who received docetaxel post-abiraterone had more bone metastases, more visceral metastases, higher baseline PSA, and had more frequent PSA tests while on-treatment. There were no significant differences in PSA30 (41% for enzalutamide vs. 53% for docetaxel) or PSA50 (34% vs. 40%) response rates between the two groups; there remained no difference after stratifying by presence/absence of prior response to abiraterone.

Systemic vasculitis is classified as primary (eg, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome) or secondary, the latter associated with connective tissue disorders, infections, medications, and rarely, as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. Neuropathy is a common complication of systemic vasculitis and is related to ischemic nerve fiber damage with axon loss. Peripheral neuropathy may be the sole manifestation of vasculitis, a condition termed nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Treatment of vasculitic neuropathy requires long-term immunosuppressive therapies with potential side effects. The diagnosis of vasculitis should be established by tissue (preferably nerve) biopsy. High-dose prednisone is the standard platform therapy for patients with systemic and NSVN; for those with systemic vasculitis, at least 3 to 12 months of treatment with cyclophosphamide (monthly intravenous pulse or daily oral therapy) is also necessary to sustain remission and allow successful prednisone tapering. The use of cyclophosphamide in patients with NSVN is controversial , but recent retrospective data suggest that those treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide from the outset fare better than those initially treated only with prednisone . If prednisone is administered as monotherapy, cyclophosphamide should be added after several months if there is no improvement or relapse occurs with tapering of prednisone.

One resistance mechanism for cediranib is up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This study aimed to determine if dual therapy with cediranib and the oral EGFR inhibitor gefitinib improved outcome in recurrent glioblastoma. ### Methods And Findings This was a multi-center randomized , two-armed , double-blinded phase II study comparing cediranib plus gefitinib versus cediranib plus placebo in subjects with first relapse/first progression of glioblastoma following surgery and chemoradiotherapy . The primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and radiologic response rate. Recruitment was terminated early following suspension of the cediranib program. 38 subjects (112 planned) were enrolled with 19 subjects in each treatment arm. Median PFS with cediranib plus gefitinib was 3.6 months compared to 2.8 months for cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.72, 90% CI; 0.41 to 1.26).

Since the first detection, in December 2019, there have been no effective drug therapy options for treating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, healthcare professionals are using chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, convalescent plasma and some other options of treatments. This study aims to compare the biological , molecular , pharmacological , and clinical characteristics of these three treatment modalities for SARS-COV-2 infections , Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine , Convalescent Plasma , and Remdesivir . ### methods A search was conducted in the \"Institute of Science Information (ISI)-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library databases, Scopus, and Google Scholar\" for peer reviewed, published studies and clinical trials through July 30, 2020. The search was based on keywords \"COVID-19\" SARS-COV-2, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, convalescent plasma, remdesivir and treatment modalities. ### results As of July 30, 2020, a total of 36,640 relevant documents were published. From them 672 peer reviewed, published articles, and clinical trials were screened. We selected 17 relevant published original articles and clinical trials: 05 for chloroquine and/or hydroxychloroquine with total sample size (n\u202f=\u202f220), 05 for remdesivir (n\u202f=\u202f1,781), and 07 for Convalescent Plasma therapy (n\u202f=\u202f398), with a combined total sample size (n\u202f=\u202f2,399). Based on the available data, convalescent plasma therapy showed clinical advantages in SARS-COV-2 patients. ### conclusions All three treatment modalities have both favorable and unfavorable characteristics, but none showed clear evidence of benefit for early outpatient disease or prophylaxis. Based on the current available data, convalescent plasma therapy appears to show clinical advantages for inpatient use. In the future, ongoing large sample size randomized controlled clinical trials may further clarify the comparative efficacy and safety of these three treatment classes, to conclusively determine whom to treat with which drug and when to treat them.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32921965/"}

The methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin (MVAC) regimen has been the standard treatment in patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer for the past 15 years. The minimal or moderate survival benefit-depending on prognostic features-and the severe toxicity associated with the MVAC regimen have made the search for new drugs and drug combinations of utmost importance to increase efficacy and/or decrease toxicity. In this respect, the taxanes and gemcitabine are promising new drugs. Paclitaxel and docetaxel as single agents have yielded overall response rates of 7 % to 56 % , depending on whether the patients have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease . The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin has been explored in three studies with a total of 104 evaluable patients, a pooled overall response (OR) rate of 61%, and a complete response (CR) rate of 20%. There are two studies of docetaxel and cisplatin with a total of 91 evaluable patients, an OR rate of 54%, and a CR rate of 16%. The OR rate for paclitaxel and carboplatin in six studies was 43%, with a CR rate of 13%; however, the reported median survival was only 8.5 to 9.5 months. The OR rate for single-agent gemcitabine based on five studies was 26%, with a CR rate of 9%, which was apparently independent of whether the patients had received prior chemotherapy. The OR rate for gemcitabine and cisplatin in four phase II studies ranged from 41% to 57%, with a CR rate of 15% to 22% and a median survival of 12.5 to 14.3 months. Based on the encouraging results for the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC), a randomized phase III trial comparing GC and MVAC was begun in late 1996. This study of 405 randomized patients showed that the two regimens were associated with similar response rates, time to progression, and overall survival, whereas GC was associated with less toxicity than MVAC. On the basis of this superior risk-benefit ratio, the GC regimen should be favored as a new standard treatment in patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer. Other promising combinations include gemcitabine and paclitaxel, with or without cisplatin, and the combination of ifosfamide, paclitaxel, and cisplatin. The triple combination of gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and cisplatin has yielded an OR rate of 78%, a CR rate of 28%, and a median survival of 24 months.

Based on the hypothesis that antagonizing the effects of IL-6 improves the outcome of DSA-positive late ABMR by counteracting DSA-triggered inflammation and B cell/plasma cell-driven alloimmunity, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide proof of concept of a novel treatment of this type of rejection. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03444103 .

The aim of this study was to find an experimental model of a donor-recipient rat strain combination that , under triple drug immunosuppressive treatment ( methylprednisolone , cyclosporine , and azathioprine ) , would develop chronic rejection within a few weeks . ### methods Renal transplantations were performed in strain combinations of DA-->AO, PVG-->BN, and DA-->BN. In each group, 5-8 animals received triple drug treatment of methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg), azathioprine (2 mg/kg), and cyclosporine (5 mg/kg) daily, 5-10 animals were left without treatment, and 6 syngenic transplantations were performed. The grafts were monitored with ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsies to quantify the inflammation in the graft. Graft histology was performed in parallel and quantified by using the chronic allograft damage index (CADI). ### results In nonimmunosuppressed animals, irreversible acute rejection with a high peak of inflammation appeared in every strain combination within 5-8 days. In triple drug-treated rats, the DA-->AO combination demonstrated a prolonged acute rejection but no characteristic chronic changes, and the PVG-->BN combination showed practically no inflammation and did not develop any signs of chronic rejection within 60 days (CADI: 2.7+/-2.1), but the DA-->BN combination showed an early, mild inflammatory response 5-7 days after transplantation and developed chronic rejection within 40-60 days after transplantation (CADI: 7.9+/-3.1). Syngenic animals showed no inflammation or histological alterations (CADI: 1.7+/-2.0). ### conclusions In conclusion, in the DA-->BN combination with triple drug treatment, early mild inflammation was followed by the development of chronic rejection and can be used as an experimental model that resembles the clinical situation in renal transplantation.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9448142/"}

Objective Some previous studies have found clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and cilostazol for prevention of secondary stroke, but the physiological mechanism involved remains unknown. We aimed to clarify the effects of aspirin/cilostazol therapy on the platelet and endothelial functions of patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, in comparison to patients who were treated with aspirin alone. Methods The present randomized prospective pilot study enrolled 24 patients within a week after the onset of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (100 mg/day) (A group; 11 patients) or cilostazol (200 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) (CA group; 13 patients). We measured platelet aggregation, platelet activation, and the thrombomodulin (TM), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and von Willebrand (vWF) antigen levels and vWF activity over a 4-week period after enrollment. Results There was no significant difference in the platelet functions of the A and CA groups. However, the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was decreased at 2 and 4 weeks (p<0.05) after treatment in comparison to the pre-treatment values in the CA group, but not in the A group. Platelet activation, and the hs-CRP, TM, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and vWF values did not significantly decrease after treatment in either group. Conclusion Although there were no significant differences in platelet aggregation, platelet activation or the endothelial biomarker levels of the A and CA groups, dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol inhibited platelet aggregation in comparison to the pre-treatment values, similarly to patients who received aspirin alone. This may suggest the clinical usefulness of dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol in the treatment of patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28566591/"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS RNA was extracted from 1,372 tumor blocks from postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer in the monotherapy arms of ATAC. Twenty-one genes were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the RS was calculated. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the value of adding RS to a model with clinical variables (age, tumor size, grade, and treatment) in node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) women. RESULTS Reportable scores were available from 1,231 evaluable patients (N0, n = 872; N+, n = 306; and node status unknown, n = 53); 72, 74, and six DRs occurred in N0, N+, and node status unknown patients, respectively. For both N0 and N+ patients, RS was significantly associated with time to DR in multivariate analyses (P < .001 for N0 and P = .002 for N+). RS also showed significant prognostic value beyond that provided by Adjuvant! Online (P < .001).

Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. Biologics are usually combined with traditional DMARDs, primarily methotrexate (MTX), but some biologics and tofacitinib (together referred to in this article as novel DMARDs) have been shown to be efficacious as monotherapy as well. In real-world practice, approximately one-third of RA patients receiving biologics are on monotherapy, primarily because of intolerance of, or noncompliance with, MTX. Limited data, however, are available analyzing the effectiveness of monotherapy compared with combination therapy across novel DMARDs. ### objective To compare American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses to approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) at 24 weeks in RA patients who have shown inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (DMARD-IR). ### methods Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified randomized controlled trials that assessed approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX in DMARD-IR RA patients. Twenty-eight RCTs were identified that evaluated abatacept, anakinra, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. ACR responses at 24 weeks were extracted and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analyses. ### results With the exception of anakinra plus MTX, which was less efficacious, most novel DMARDs, when used in combination with MTX, demonstrated comparable ACR responses. When novel DMARDs were used as monotherapies , greater ACR20/50/70 responses were observed with tocilizumab than with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents ( aTNF ) or tofacitinib . Furthermore, ACR20/50/70 responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab monotherapy (odds ratio [OR] for the indirect comparison\u2009=\u20091.08, 95% credible interval [CrI]\u2009=\u20090.40-2.84; OR\u2009=\u20091.24, CrI\u2009=\u20090.44-3.61; OR\u2009=\u20090.95, CrI\u2009=\u20090.33-2.72, respectively), whereas greater responses were observed with aTNF plus MTX than with aTNF monotherapy (OR\u2009=\u20092.41, CrI\u2009=\u20090.51-11.61; OR\u2009=\u20092.85, CrI\u2009=\u20090.51-17.67; OR\u2009=\u20091.28, CrI\u2009=\u20090.21-8.42, respectively). Relative efficacy estimates for the indirect comparison of tofacitinib plus MTX with tofacitinib monotherapy were very uncertain. ### conclusions Results suggest that in combination with MTX most of the available novel DMARDs have similar levels of efficacy in DMARD-IR patients. As monotherapy, however, tocilizumab displayed higher ACR responses than aTNF or tofacitinib. ACR responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab as monotherapy, whereas aTNF in combination with MTX demonstrated greater ACR responses than aTNF as monotherapy.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25943002/"}

Historically, ephedrine has been the vasopressor of choice for treatment of most cases of hypotension in obstetric patients.

The current study evaluated whether ephedrine or phenylephrine better restores uterine blood flow and fetal oxygenation during ritodrine infusion and epidural anesthesia-induced hypotension in gravid ewes. ### methods Fourteen chronically instrumented gravid ewes between 0.8 and 0.9 timed gestational age were used. On separate days, each animal underwent the experimental protocol with one of three agents: ephedrine, phenylephrine, and normal saline-control. The experimental protocol was as follows : ( 1 ) at time zero , intravenous infusion of ritodrine was begun ; ( 2 ) at 120 min , 2 % lidocaine was given epidurally to achieve a sensory level of at least T6 ; and ( 3 ) at 135 min , an intravenous bolus of either ephedrine , phenylephrine , or normal saline-control was given , followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of the same agent for 30 min . In the ephedrine and phenylephrine experiments, the rate of infusion was adjusted to maintain maternal mean arterial pressure close to baseline. ### results ritodrine infusion alone significantly increased maternal heart rate and cardiac output in all three groups. Epidural anesthesia during ritodrine infusion significantly decreased maternal mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, uterine blood flow, and fetal arterial oxygen tension for each of the three groups. Both ephedrine and phenylephrine restored maternal mean arterial pressure to baseline, as designed. Ephedrine significantly increased uterine blood flow and fetal arterial oxygen tension when compared with normal saline--control, but phenylephrine did not. phenylephrine significantly increased uterine vascular resistance when compared with normal saline--control, but ephedrine did not. ### conclusions Although ephedrine and phenylephrine provided similar restoration of maternal mean arterial pressure, ephedrine was superior to phenylephrine in restoring uterine blood flow during ritodrine infusion and epidural anesthesia-induced hypotension in gravid ewes.

The thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (TBF) protocol has recently demonstrated promising outcome in cord blood and haploidentical SCT; however, there is limited evidence about this regimen in transplant from matched siblings (MSD) and unrelated donors (UD). We retrospectively compared outcomes of 2523 patients aged 18-50 with AML in remission, undergoing transplant from MSD or UD prepared with either TBF or BuCy conditioning.

These two regimens consisted either of fractionated total body irradiation and etoposide (FTBI/VP-16) or high-dose busulfan with cyclophosphamide (BU/CY). Only patients who had failed prior conventional management at least once were study eligible, ie, no patients with acute leukemia in first remission (CR) or in first chronic phase (CP) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) participated. Patients were stratified according to the following risk criteria: \"good-risk\" patients were those who were in second CR of their acute leukemia or in accelerated phase (AP) of CML; \"poor-risk\" patients had further advanced stages of leukemia. During a 52-month period, 131 patients were registered of whom 122 (93%) were study eligible. Sixty-one eligible patients were randomized to the FTBI/VP-16 arm and 61 to the BU/CY regimen.

We examined the reactivity of factor IXa with several isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains: basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2, and the first two inhibitor domains of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. We find that enhancement of factor IXa reactivity by enoxaparin is greatest for basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (>10-fold), followed by the second tissue factor pathway inhibitor domain (1.7-fold) and the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2 (1.4-fold). Modeling studies of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor suggest that binding of this inhibitor is sterically hindered by the 99-loop of factor IXa, specifically residue Lys(98). Slow-binding kinetic studies support the formation of a weak initial enzyme-inhibitor complex between factor IXa and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor that is facilitated by enoxaparin binding. Mutation of Lys(98) to Ala in factor IXa results in enhanced reactivity with all inhibitors examined, whereas almost completely abrogating the enhancing effects of enoxaparin.

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors modulate signaling pathways involved in cell cycle progression, and recent phase II trials demonstrate activity in patients with endometrial cancer. Our objective was to examine the effects of combination therapy with rapamycin and paclitaxel in endometrial cancer cell lines. paclitaxel inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines with IC(50) values of 0.1-0.5 nM and 1-5 nM for Ishikawa and ECC-1 cells, respectively. To assess synergy of paclitaxel and rapamycin, the combination index (CI) was calculated by the method of Chou and Talalay. Simultaneous exposure of cells to various doses of paclitaxel in combination with rapamycin (1 nM) resulted in a significant synergistic anti-proliferative effect (CI <1, range 0.131-0.920). rapamycin alone did not induce apoptosis, but combined treatment with paclitaxel increased apoptosis over that of paclitaxel alone. Treatment with rapamycin and paclitaxel resulted in decreased phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 , two critical downstream targets of the mTOR pathway . rapamycin decreased hTERT mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR while paclitaxel alone had no effect on telomerase activity. paclitaxel increased polymerization and acetylation of tubulin, and rapamycin appeared to enhance this effect. Thus, in conclusion, we demonstrate that rapamycin potentiates the effects of paclitaxel in endometrial cancer cells through inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and potentially increased polymerization and acetylation of tubulin.

The aim of this project was to identify novel relevant markers of CML LSCs. ### Experimental Design CML LSCs were examined by flow cytometry, qPCR, and various bioassays. In addition, we examined the multipotent CD25(+)CML cell line KU812. ### results In contrast to normal hematopoietic stem cells, CD34(+)/CD38(-)CML LSCs expressed the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, IL-2RA (CD25).

On the first post-operative day she became septic due to a surgical wound infection. Despite being treated according to the therapeutic protocols for sepsis, no clinical improvement was noticed and further assessment revealed an underlying immunodeficiency.

LV pressures, left atrial pressures, and regional segment lengths were measured in anterior and posterior midwall. A cylindrical ultrasound probe (0.9 MHz, 25 W) mounted on a catheter was inserted into the LV cavity through the apex and was activated for 4 minutes in each condition. In protocol A (n = 7), LV volume was altered with caval vein occlusion and intravenous dextran infusion. The ultrasound probe was activated at low (4.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg), mid (10.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), and high (17.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg) LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP). Effects of ultrasound were less pronounced at higher EDP.

In patients treated with decitabine plus VA, dose-limiting encephalopathy occurred in two of two patients at VA 25 mg/kg/d and one of six patients at VA 20 mg/kg/d. Drug-induced re-expression of estrogen receptor (ER) was associated with clinical response (P < or = .05). ER promoter demethylation, global DNA hypomethylation, depletion of DNA methyltransferase enzyme, and histone hyperacetylation were also observed.

Melanoma has two key features, an over-representation of UV-induced mutations and resistance to DNA damaging chemotherapy agents. Both of these features may result from dysfunction of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, in particular the DNA damage detection branch, global genome repair (GGR). The key GGR component XPC does not respond to DNA damage in melanoma, the cause of this lack of response has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the role of methylation in reduced XPC in melanoma. ### methods To reduce methylation and induce DNA-damage, melanoma cell lines were treated with decitabine and carboplatin, individually and sequentially. Global DNA methylation levels, XPC mRNA and protein expression and methylation of the XPC promoter were examined. Apoptosis, cell proliferation and senescence were also quantified. XPC siRNA was used to determine that the responses seen were reliant on XPC induction. ### results Treatment with high-dose decitabine resulted in global demethylation, including the the shores of the XPC CpG island and significantly increased XPC mRNA expression. Lower, clinically relevant dose of decitabine also resulted in global demethylation including the CpG island shores and induced XPC in 50% of cell lines. decitabine followed by DNA-damaging carboplatin treatment led to significantly higher XPC expression in 75% of melanoma cell lines tested. Combined sequential treatment also resulted in a greater apoptotic response in 75% of cell lines compared to carboplatin alone, and significantly slowed cell proliferation, with some melanoma cell lines going into senescence. Inhibiting the increased XPC using siRNA had a small but significant negative effect, indicating that XPC plays a partial role in the response to sequential decitabine and carboplatin. ### conclusions Demethylation using decitabine increased XPC and apoptosis after sequential carboplatin.

There is an increasing use and variety of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) available for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Recent comparative studies suggest that atenolol ( 200 mg daily ) , metoprolol ( 200 mg daily ) ; acebutolol ( 400 mg daily ) , oxprenolol ( 160 mg daily ) , nadolol ( 80 mg daily ) and timolol ( 20 mg daily ) produce a beneficial clinical response equal to that seen with propranolol ( 160 mg daily ) . Most beta-blockers reduce resting heart rate by approximately 25 to 30 beats/min, although a lesser reduction is seen with those possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as oxprenolol and pindolol. While earlier studies employing large doses of intravenous propranolol concluded that beta-blockade reduced myocardial contractility, more recent non-invasive studies suggest that the predominant cardiac effect is on heart rate. In patients with cardiac failure, beta-blockers may, however, produce a profound fall in cardiac output. Nevertheless, in combination with digoxin they may be useful in controlling the atrial fibrillation of thyrocardiac disease. beta-Blockers improve nervousness and tremor (although to a lesser extent with cardioselective agents) and severe myopathy, and they also reduce the frequency of paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. There is often subjective improvement in sweating but usually no major effect on eye signs. Recent studies show a 10% reduction in oxygen consumption/basal metabolic rate with long term oral use of selective or nonselective beta-blockers. In addition, many agents (propranolol, metoprolol, nadolol and sotalol but not acebutolol, atenolol or oxprenolol) reduce circulating tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentration by between 10 and 40%, although the clinical significance of this effect (if any) is not established. beta-Blockers may also have endocrinological effects on gastrin, cyclic AMP, catecholamines and other hormone levels. Given in adequate dosage, propranolol has been shown to control thyrotoxic hypercalcaemia. Minor side effects (nausea, headaches, tiredness, etc.) are quite common but overall beta-blockers are well tolerated by the thyrotoxic patient. The major use of these drugs is in symptomatic control while awaiting definitive diagnosis or treatment. As an adjunct to antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine, beta-blockers will produce a satisfactory clinical response in the weeks to months before these forms of therapy produce a euthyroid state. beta-Blockers are more convenient than antithyroid drugs in the control of patients receiving therapeutic radioiodine, in that continuous therapy and assessment of biochemical response is possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6144501/"}

We have evaluated the direct cytotoxic effect of rHuTNF on a human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line in vitro (A2774), alone or in combination with etoposide (VP16) or doxorubicin (Doxo), some topoisomerase II (Topo II) targeted drugs, or in combination with cisplatin (CDDP), a not Topo II interactive drug. Our results suggest that rHuTNF is directly cytotoxic and that it is also able to induce a potentiation of VP16- or Doxo-cytotoxicity, but it is unable to potentiate CDDP-cytotoxicity. These data represent a reasonable basis for combining rHuTNF with Topo II inhibitors within phase I studies. The combination regimen could be tested in ovarian cancer patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11576250/"}

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy as the over-expressed MDR protein acts as an efflux pump, which leads to a reduction in the uptake of the anticancer agent by tumour cells. We combined topotecan and amlodipine together into the stealthy liposomes, in which amlodipine was applied as a MDR reversing agent to overcome the resistance. ### Materials And Methods Cytotoxicity, apoptosis and the signalling pathway assays were performed on human chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562, promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 and MDR HL-60 cells, respectively. Pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity studies were performed on normal Kunming mice and female BALB/c nude mice with MDR HL-60 xenografts, respectively. ### results topotecan alone was effective in inhibiting the growth of non-resistant leukaemia cells, K562 and HL-60 cells but not the growth of MDR HL-60 cells. The resistance of topotecan in MDR HL-60 cells was potently reversed by the addition of amlodipine . Moreover, amlodipine enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of topotecan synergistically. Apoptosis was through activating caspases in a cascade: first, the initiator caspase 8 and then effectors caspase 3/7 (total activity of caspases 3 and 7) were activated. Being encapsulated into the stealthy liposomes with an acidic internal medium, topotecan existed dominantly in an active lactone species, which was reversibly changed from an inactive carboxylate form via a pH-dependent reaction. After administration of stealthy liposomes to mice, the blood exposure of the lactone form was evidently increased and extended. The antitumour effects in the MDR HL-60 xenografted tumour were stealthy liposomal topotecan (SLT) plus amlodipine > SLT > un-encapsulated topotecan > blank control. ### conclusions The enhanced antitumour activity in the MDR HL-60 cells by the SLT plus amlodipine could be owing to multiple reasons: (a) synergistic apoptosis inducing effect, (b) reversing MDR by amlodipine and (c) increasing the availability of active lactone of topotecan by the stealthy liposomes. The apoptosis induced by amlodipine is through caspase 8 and then the 3/7 signalling pathway.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16684125/"}

However, clinical use of the terfenadine has been associated with rare but severe cardiac arrhythmias, in particular torsades de pointes. ### objective To establish a quantitative experimental model for assessing the sedating and cardiotoxicity potential of non-sedating and sedating antihistamines. ### methods Drugs were administered intravenously and the integrated amplitude of the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) signal was recorded. The threshold dose that depressed EEG activity was compared with the dose required to inhibit by 50% the peripheral bronchospasm elicited by 10 micrograms/kg i.v., of histamine.

We were unable to evaluate the EEG effects of terfenadine, because it produced cardiovascular collapse at 10 mg/kg, i.v. loratadine and promethazine did not produce adverse cardiovascular effects, nor did they alter normal ECG activity. diphenhydramine produced bradycardia followed by a transient hypertensive phase without affecting the QTc interval. In contrast, terfenadine elicited hypotension, bradycardia and significant arrhythmogenic activity, causing a prolongation of the QTc interval and a torsades de pointes--like ventricular arrhythmia. Pharmacokinetic studies after i.v. administration of loratadine (30 and 100 mg/kg) demonstrated plasma levels of loratadine and its major metabolite descarboethoxyloratadine to be several orders of magnitude greater than levels found in humans at the clinical dose of 10 mg. ### conclusion The CNS depressant effects of H1 antihistamines are promethazine approximately diphenhydramine >> loratadine = placebo. Of the non-sedating antihistamines, loratadine was devoid of adverse cardiovascular effects whereas terfenadine caused a pronounced disruption of the normal ECG, characterized by a torsades de pointes-like effect.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8556569/"}

Regimen 1 was pemetrexed (200-600 mg/m(2)); regimen 2 was pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) with escalating carboplatin doses (AUC = 4-6). Both regimens included concurrent radiation (40-66 Gy; palliative-intent doses were lower). ### results Thirty patients (18 locally advanced and 12 metastatic with dominant local symptoms) were enrolled, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0/1/2 (n = 8/21/1). All dose levels were tolerable for regimen 1 (n = 18: 15 NSCLC and 3 esophageal cancers) and regimen 2 (n = 12: all NSCLC). In regimen 1, one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 4 esophagitis/anorexia) occurred (500 mg/m(2)). Grade 3 neutropenia (3 of 18 patients) was the main hematologic toxicity.

Here we assessed whether inhibiting repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a reasonable strategy for sensitizing glioma cells to alkylating agents. For down-regulation of HR in glioma cells, we used an interference RNA (iRNA) approach targeting Rad51 and BRCA2, and for NHEJ we employed the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026. We also assessed whether inhibition of poly(ADP)ribosyltransferase (PARP) by olaparib would enhance the killing effect. The data show that knockdown of Rad51 or BRCA2 greatly sensitizes cells to DSBs and the induction of cell death following temozolomide and nimustine ( ACNU ) . It did not sensitize to ionizing radiation (IR). The expression of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) abolished all these effects, indicating that O(6)-alkylguanine induced by these drugs is the primary lesion responsible for the formation of DSBs and increased sensitivity of glioma cells following knockdown of Rad51 and BRCA2. Inhibition of DNA-PK only slightly sensitized to temozolomide whereas a significant effect was observed with IR. A triple strategy including siRNA and the PARP inhibitor olaparib further improved the killing effect of temozolomide. The data provides evidence that down-regulation of Rad51 or BRCA2 is a reasonable strategy for sensitizing glioma cells to killing by O(6)-alkylating anti-cancer drugs. The data also provide proof of principle that a triple strategy involving down-regulation of HR, PARP inhibition and MGMT depletion may greatly enhance the therapeutic effect of temozolomide.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22073281/"}

During recent years, more intensified systemic and local treatment regimens have increased the 5-year survival figures in localized Ewing's sarcoma to more than 60%. There is, however, concern about the risk of second malignancies (SM) in long-term survivors. We have analyzed the second malignancies in patients treated in the German Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. ### Materials And Methods From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991). The systemic treatment in both studies consisted of a four-drug-regimen ( VACA = vincristine , actinomycin D , cyclophosphamide , and adriamycin ; or VAIA = vincristine , actinomycin D , ifosfamide , and adriamycin ) and a total number of four courses , each lasting nine weeks , was recommended by the protocol . Local therapy in curative patients was either complete surgery (n = 162), surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy (n = 274), or definitive radiotherapy with 46-60Gy (n = 212). The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years. ### results The overall survival of all patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years. Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM. Five of these were acute myelogenic leukemias (n = 4) or MDS (n = 1), and three were sarcomas. The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four AMLs, 96 months for the MDS and 82-136 months for the three sarcomas. The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years. Out of five patients with AML/MDS, three died of rapid AML-progression, and two are living with disease. Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of AML/MDS, but local therapy did influence the risk of secondary sarcomas. All three patients with secondary sarcomas had received radiotherapy; however, all three sarcomas were salvaged by subsequent treatment and are in clinical remission with a follow-up of 1 month, 4.3 years, and 7.5 years after the diagnosis of the secondary sarcoma. Thus far, SM contributed to less than 1 % (3/328) of all deaths in the CESS-studies. ### conclusions The risk of leukemia after treatment for Ewing's sarcoma is probably in the range of 2%. The risk of solid tumors also seems to be low within the first 10 years after treatment and remains in the range of 5 % after 15 years. In the CESS-studies, less than 1% of all deaths within the first 10 years after diagnosis were caused by SM. Effective salvage therapy for secondary sarcomas is feasible.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9788419/"}

Different antidepressant drugs are currently used for the treatment of depression in cancer patients, such as second-generation antidepressants and, recently, the extracts of Hypericum perforatum. These agents are susceptible to metabolically-based drug interactions with anticancer drugs. The aim of the present article is to provide an updated review of clinically relevant metabolic drug interactions between selected anticancer drugs and antidepressants, focusing on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and Hypericum extract. SSRIs can cause pharmacokinetic interactions through their in vitro ability to inhibit one or more cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs). SSRIs differ in their potential for metabolic drug interactions with anticancer drugs. Fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 and administration of these SSRIs reduces the clinical benefit of an anticancer drug , such as tamoxifen , by decreasing the formation of active metabolites of this drug . Women with breast cancer who receive paroxetine in combination with tamoxifen are at increased risk for death. Other SSRIs, including citalopram, escitalopram, are weak or negligible inhibitors of CYP2D6 and are less likely to interact with anticancer drugs, while sertraline causes significant inhibition of this isoform only at high doses. Hypericum extract, by inducing both the CYP3A4 and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), can reduce the plasma concentrations of different antineoplastic agents such as imatinib, irinotecan and docetaxel, thus reducing the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Although these interactions are often predictable, the use of fluoxetine, paroxetine and Hypericum extract should be avoided in cancer patients.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21395523/"}

Despite advances in molecular medicine over recent decades, there has been little advancement in the treatment of osteosarcoma. We performed comprehensive molecular profiling in two cases of metastatic and chemotherapy-refractory osteosarcoma to guide molecularly targeted therapy. ### Patients And Methods Hybridization capture of >300 cancer-related genes plus introns from 28 genes often rearranged or altered in cancer was applied to >50 ng of DNA extracted from tumor samples from two patients with recurrent, metastatic osteosarcoma. The DNA from each sample was sequenced to high, uniform coverage. Immunohistochemical probes and morphoproteomics analysis were performed, in addition to fluorescence in situ hybridization. All analyses were performed in CLIA-certified laboratories. Molecularly targeted therapy based on the resulting profiles was offered to the patients. Biomedical analytics were performed using QIAGEN's Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis. ### results In Patient #1, comprehensive next-generation exome sequencing showed MET amplification, PIK3CA mutation, CCNE1 amplification, and PTPRD mutation. Immunohistochemistry-based morphoproteomic analysis revealed c-Met expression [(p)-c-Met (Tyr1234/1235)] and activation of mTOR/AKT pathway [IGF-1R (Tyr1165/1166), p-mTOR [Ser2448], p-Akt (Ser473)] and expression of SPARC and COX2. Targeted therapy was administered to match the P1K3CA , c-MET , and SPARC and COX2 aberrations with sirolimus+ crizotinib and abraxane+ celecoxib . In Patient #2, aberrations included NF2 loss in exons 2-16, PDGFR\u03b1 amplification, and TP53 mutation. This patient was enrolled on a clinical trial combining targeted agents temsirolimus, sorafenib and bevacizumab, to match NF2, PDGFR\u03b1 and TP53 aberrations. Both the patients did not benefit from matched therapy. ### conclusions Relapsed osteosarcoma is characterized by complex signaling and drug resistance pathways. Comprehensive molecular profiling holds great promise for tailoring personalized therapies for cancer. Methods for such profiling are evolving and need to be refined to better assist clinicians in making treatment decisions based on the large amount of data that results from this type of testing. Further research in this area is warranted.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26510912/"}

Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus vs other limb vs axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no vs yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m ### findings Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 62\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b76-76\u00b76); 62\u00b73 months (IQR 46\u00b79-77\u00b71) for the MAP group and 61\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b75-75\u00b73) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group vs 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group vs 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b798 [95% CI 0\u00b778-1\u00b723]); hazards were non-proportional (p=0\u00b70003). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (268 [89%] patients in MAP vs 268 [90%] in MAPIE), thrombocytopenia (231 [78% in MAP vs 248 [83%] in MAPIE), and febrile neutropenia without documented infection (149 [50%] in MAP vs 217 [73%] in MAPIE). MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity than MAP (35 [12%] of 301 in the MAP group vs 71 [24%] of 298 in the MAPIE group). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one from infection (although their absolute neutrophil count was normal), which was definitely related to their MAP treatment (specifically doxorubicin and cisplatin), and one from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was probably related to MAPIE treatment (specifically doxorubicin). One suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction was reported in the MAP group: bone marrow infarction due to methotrexate. ### interpretation EURAMOS-1 results do not support the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to postoperative chemotherapy in patients with poorly responding osteosarcoma because its administration was associated with increased toxicity without improving event-free survival . The results define standard of care for this population.

However , clindamycin possesses only one of the two mechanisms of lincomycin action , which is bacteriostatic , against Escherichia coli . The relative potency of action of a clindamycin-lincomycin combination against Staph. aureus is variable, and the effective ratio ranges between 5:1 and 9:1; the effective ratio against E. coli is fixed at 6:1 over a wide concentration range. This difference is attributed to differences in bioavailability and/or binding characteristics of the drugs for bioreceptors, as a consequence of structural modifications in the drug molecules, and to differences in modes of action in the respective organisms. Mixtures containing equipotent fractions of clindamycin and lincomycin show \"equivalence\" or \"indifference\" of effects on Staph. aureus. The combined action of the mixtures can be quantitatively predicted from the separate dose-response curves of either component drug alone. Therefore, it is concluded that clindamycin and lincomycin may bind to the same receptor site that is engaged in microbial protein synthesis to inhibit the generation of Staph. aureus. However, combinations of clindamycin and lincomycin are less active than the a priori equipotent concentration of either drug alone in their action against E. coli, demonstrating unequivocally an antagonism of effects. Furthermore, the degree of antagonism is dependent on the order of addition of the drugs, which is attributed to the possibility that clindamycin and lincomycin bind differently on active and allosteric loci of the same receptor site functionally engaged in protein synthesis in E. coli. A rational approach to the quantification and prediction of combined antibiotic action must, therefore, be based not only on the kinetics and mechanisms of action as well as on the dose-response relationship over a wide concentration range for the separate antibiotics but also on the strain and species of the test organism.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1102659/"}

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (TKI) has changed the treatment paradigm of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). The recent CARMENA and SURTIME trials challenged the role of the cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN). ### objective To assess the impact of CN prior to TKI therapy in patients with mRCC in a real-world setting. ### methods Overall, 262 consecutive patients with mRCC were treated with CN plus TKI or TKI only at our institution between 2000 and 2016. Patients with prior immunotherapy or metastasectomy were excluded. Multiple imputation and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to account for missing values and imbalances between the treatment groups, respectively. Unadjusted and adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to determine differences in progression-free (PFS), overall (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). ### results Overall, 104 (40%) patients received CN before TKI treatment. Most frequent first line therapy was Sunitinib ( 66 % ) , followed by Sorafenib ( 20 % ) and Pazopanib ( 10 % ) . After adjustment with IPTW, there was no difference in PFS, CSS, and OS (all P > 0.05) between the treatment groups. In subgroup analyses, CSS was improved when CN was performed in patients with sarcomatoid features and clear cell histology (P\u202f=\u202f0.04 and P\u202f=\u202f0.03) and PFS was improved in patients with clear cell histology when CN was performed [0.04]). CN did not improve OS in any subgroup analysis. ### conclusion The role of CN remains controversial. We found no difference in survival outcomes between patients treated with and without CN before TKI therapy. However, CN was associated with improved survival in specific patient subgroups. Tailored, individualized treatment is key to further improve oncological outcomes for mRCC.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32576526/"}

Therefore, nanotechnology gained special attention as it has potential to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduction in dosing frequency. ### objective The aim of this study is to fabricate alginate-chitosan nanoparticles (AL-CS NPs) under appropriate conditions using ionic gelation method. The use of natural polymers in nanoparticle fabrication has a vast application due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility and nontoxic nature. Ionic gelation method involves the interaction between macromolecules with opposite charged ionizable groups forming polyelectrolyte complex. Hence, it is rational to formulate natural polymerbased sustained release nano-particulate matrix to improve patient adherence, reducing dose frequency and drug toxicity. ### method The formulations were based on 32 factorial designs. Nanoparticles of combined drug (isoniazid- INH and pyrazinamide-PYZ) were fabricated using natural polymer.

Previously, we have shown that orally administered topiramate, a sulfamate-substituted fructopyranose derivative, appears to accentuate rather than diminish some aspects of methamphetamine-induced positive subjective mood and cognitive performance. One possible mechanism by which this might occur would be for topiramate to increase plasma methamphetamine level. Such an effect also would be expected to enhance methamphetamine-induced hemodynamic response. We, therefore, studied -- in the same experiment from which the previous findings originated -- the effects of topiramate on the kinetic profile and hemodynamic response to methamphetamine. In a 27-day inpatient study , 10 methamphetamine-dependent individuals participated in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over design , with oral doses of topiramate ( 0 , 100 , and 200 mg ) administered as a pretreatment before intravenous doses of methamphetamine ( 0 , 15 , and 30 mg ) . The 3x3 factorial combination of topiramate and methamphetamine resulted in a sequence of the nine treatments administered to each subject in an order determined by a 9x9 Latin Square design. methamphetamine alone was associated with prototypical increases in hemodynamic response that were not altered in the presence of topiramate. While there was no significant kinetic interaction between topiramate and methamphetamine, there was a non-significant trend for topiramate to increase plasma methamphetamine level. No significant adverse events were reported. The combination of topiramate and methamphetamine at pharmacologically relevant doses appears to be safe. Larger laboratory studies with chronic dosing regimens are needed to establish whether or not there is a kinetic interaction between topiramate and methamphetamine.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17184890/"}

In phase I studies, dose-limiting toxicities of lenalidomide were limited to myelosuppression and a response rate of 72% was seen in relapsed/refractory patients. Three phase II studies subsequently evaluated the efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide or lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone.

Chronic pain in the elderly is frequently a result of arthritic disorders, particularly osteoarthritis. The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as effective as standard NSAIDs for the relief of pain and for improving function in elderly patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of serious gastroduodenal adverse reactions but there is evidence that they carry a lower risk for these adverse effects than standard NSAIDs, except when there is concurrent aspirin use. Since gastroduodenal disorders are the most frequently reported serious adverse effects of NSAIDs and these disorders occur more frequently in the elderly, COX-2 inhibitors offer an alternative to standard NSAIDs in this age group. However, they are not appropriate for many patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. The adverse reaction profile of the COX-2 inhibitors has confirmed the role of the COX-2 enzyme in renal function, salt and water homeostasis and the vascular endothelium. Thus, like standard NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause renal failure, hypertension and exacerbation of cardiac failure. Of note is that these disorders are dose related. Thus, there are good reasons to avoid high doses of COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly. Clinical trials indicate that daily doses of rofecoxib 12.5 mg, celecoxib 100-200 mg, valdecoxib 10mg and etoricoxib 60 mg are the minimum effective doses of these agents. Data from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme indicate that celecoxib 200 mg/day and rofecoxib 25 mg/day are/were the most commonly prescribed doses and that 6 % of patients had taken rofecoxib 50 mg/day for longer than recommended . Recent research indicates that COX-2 inhibitors have a thrombotic potential, especially in high doses and when use is prolonged, and this further limits the extent to which they can be used in the elderly. Important interactions with COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly include those with warfarin, which can result in loss of control of anticoagulation, and those with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists and diuretics, which can result in loss of control of blood pressure and cardiac failure and, in hypovolaemic conditions, renal failure. The clinical significance of an interaction between celecoxib and aspirin to reduce the antiplatelet effect of the latter drug is unknown. Preliminary information from spontaneous reporting systems indicates that there may be differences in the risk of cardiac failure and hypertension between standard NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors and between rofecoxib and celecoxib. More formal studies using equivalent doses are needed to test this observation. Use of COX-2 inhibitors may be considered in the elderly to reduce the risk of gastroduodenal complications associated with standard NSAIDs but only when consideration has first been given to use of less toxic medicines as alternatives or supplements, the appropriate dose of the COX-2 inhibitor or standard NSAID, the presence and possible impact of co-morbidities, and the implications of taking COX-2 inhibitors with any concomitant medications. Equally important is regular monitoring of the patient taking a COX-2 inhibitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and ensuring that the patient has a continuing need to keep taking the drug. Close attention also needs to be paid to intercurrent illnesses and new prescriptions that may reduce the safety of the COX-2 inhibitor. A standard NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor may be equally effective as a COX-2 inhibitor in reducing the risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and if used the same prescribing advice applies. Current knowledge concerning the thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors suggests that this combination, if tolerated, may be preferable to a COX-2 inhibitor, particularly where prolonged use is required. This knowledge also indicates that for patients with or at high risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke, COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated.", "source": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15813652/"}

Our re-analysis relied on standard equivalence methods in which interpretation is based on Relative Risks (RRs) along with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The equivalence margins employed in our statistical testing were directly derived from those reported in randomized studies. ### results The equivalence margins were initially set at RR ranging from 0.775 to 1.29. According to these margins, triple therapy based on any NOAC proved to be superior to dual therapy alone, but at the same time demonstrated its equivalence with dual therapy. The results for apixaban-based triple therapy were inconclusive (not superior, not not-inferior, not equivalent and, of course, not inferior to the controls). Those for rivaroxaban-based triple therapy showed that this combination treatment was superior to dual therapy alone and failed to meet the criterion of equivalence. In the comparison between rivaroxaban-based triple therapy and ticagrelor + aspirin , the RR was 1 and its 95 % CI remained within a post-hoc margin of \u00b1 15 % . ### conclusions Even if one considers the most effective NOAC in combination with clopidogrel + ticagrelor, this triple therapy is not more effective than ticagrelor + aspirin. On the other hand, the increased risk of bleeding with triple regimens is well demonstrated.
