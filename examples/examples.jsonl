All patients had previously been treated by surgery and conventional chemotherapy. Eight of them had also received irradiation at doses ranging from 45 to 55 Gy at the tumor site. At the time of transplantation, 9 patients were in first relapse, 5 in second relapse and 2 in third relapse or more; all had measurable disease; 15 patients were evaluable for response. No radiologic response > 50% was observed. Stable disease and progressive disease were documented in 10 and 5 cases, respectively. The duration of response to this treatment, which lasted for a median time of 7 months (range: 5-8 months), was only evaluable in 5 patients who did not receive further treatment after ABMT. To date, there are 3 disease-free survivors at 15, 25 and 27 months all of whom were treated with second complete surgical resection and local radiotherapy (55 Gy). Toxicity was severe, mainly digestive and cutaneous, and 1 toxicity-related death occurred. Unlike medulloblastomas, ependymomas do not appear to be sensitive to this combination therapy. New therapeutic approaches are warranted."}

Digoxin alone decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 11% (p = 0.04) and increased stroke work index by 44% (p = 0.01). The combination of captopril and digoxin resulted in a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac index and stroke work index both at rest and during exercise that was greater than values observed with either drug given alone. Cardiac index response to the combination of captopril and digoxin correlated with baseline serum aldosterone concentration (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) and plasma renin activity (r = 0.74, p less than 0.0002). A significant decrease in norepinephrine concentration was noted after digoxin was administered alone or added to captopril. These findings demonstrate that in patients with severe heart failure, the acute administration of captopril and digoxin has an independent salutary hemodynamic effect. The combination of these agents, however, has an adjunctive effect on cardiac function at rest and during exercise."}

Moderate or severe vomiting occurred in 60% of patients receiving vincristine-cyclophosphamide-adriamycin, a greater frequency than in Adriamycin alone (P = .09 two-sided) Severe or life-threatening hematologic toxicity (leukocytes less than 2000, platelets less than 50,000) occurred in 30% of patients receiving the Adriamycin combination, a markedly increased frequency when compared to the other two regimens (P equals 0.07, P = 0.02, two-sided). This trial establishes that Adriamycin has a better response rate than the combination of vincristine-actinomycin-D-cyclophosphamide in advanced sarcomas. The combination of vincristine, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide increased toxicity and did not add to the therapeutic effect achieved with Adriamycin alone."}

The subsequent line of therapy should be determined on the basis of previous treatments and approved drugs available, based on the results of randomized clinical trials. Unfortunately, no phase 3 trial has compared the safety and efficacy of drugs after immunotherapy; thus, drug choice is more empirical than evidence-based. As the tumor may still be anti-VEGFR drug-na\u00efve, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for first line treatment (e.g., sunitinib or pazopanib) may be beneficial. Because this is a second-line treatment, patients could also receive axitinib, cabozantinib, or a combination of lenvatinib and everolimus. The treating physician should choose an appropriate treatment according to the patient's age, comorbidities, and tolerability of previous checkpoint inhibitors, among other considerations. Cases of patients with renal cell carcinoma refractory to checkpoint inhibitor treatment are growing, warranting a review of the activity and safety of target therapies after immunotherapy."}
