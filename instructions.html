<h2>Goal:</h2>
<p>In this task, you will need to find interactions and classify them. There are three types of classes to classify: POSitive, NEGative and COMBination. As summarized in the following table:<br/></p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Interaction description</th>
    <th>Tagging label</th>
    <th>What to annotate</th>
	<th>Example(s)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Positive interaction:</b> The sentence (perhaps with context) indicates explicitly that a helpful/useful or even synergistic combination exists between two drugs OR that it is possibly so.</td>
    <td>POS</td>
	<td>all</td>
    <td>(1) <i>These data support the recommendation that <b>ampicillin</b> plus <b>chloramphenicol</b> be used together as initial therapy for patients with suspected bacterial meningitis .</i><br/>
        (2) In the following example the synergistic interaction is implied by the `has been used` phrase: <i><b>Mefloquine</b> has been used for the treatment of malaria since the mid-1980s , first as monotherapy or as fixed combination with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( MSP ) and since the mid-1990s in combination with <b>artesunate</b> .</i><br/>
        (3) Notice in the following example the possibility/hypothesis for a positive interaction: <i><b>Mefloquine</b> has interesting antischistosomal properties , hence it might be an attractive partner drug for combination treatment with <b>praziquantel</b></i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Negative interaction:</b> The sentence (perhaps with context) indicates explicitly that a combination between the two drugs is either not helpful/useful OR harmful (antagonistic)</td>
    <td>NEG</td>
	<td>all</td>
    <td>(1) <i>The enhancement of the behavioral effect and the toxicity of <b>methamphetamine</b> may be due to inhibition of the metabolism of methamphetamine by <b>quinine</b> .</i><br/>
        (2) <i>Clinical studies in healthy volunteers show that the interaction of <b>CANCIDAS</b> with <b>itraconazole</b> does not have any effect .</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Combination: The sentence mentions a combination of drugs, but the information (including with context), does not contain sufficient information to decide whether itâ€™s one of the above classes. <br/><b>P.S.</b> (only) in this case you are asked to use the context to get to a final decision.</td>
    <td>COMB</td>
	<td>all</td>
    <td>(1) <i>Trials comparing efficacy of melphalan prednisone ( MP ) with <b>MP</b> plus <b>thalidomide</b> in transplant ineligible , elderly patients with multiple myeloma have provided conflicting evidence .</i><br/>
        (2) <i><b>Mefloquine</b> , tafenoquine , primaquine , methylene blue and lumefantrine , alone or in combination with <b>artesunate</b> , were tested in vitro against Babesia bovis .</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Not interacting:</b> The sentence mentions multiple drugs BUT not in the context of a combination (of any kind)</td>
    <td>[None]</td>
	<td>Don't annotate</td>
    <td><i>The present results show that <b>candesartan</b> and <b>amlodipine</b> are equally effective in Japanese elderly patients with high-risk hypertension .</i></td>
  </tr>

<h2>Task guidelines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>The accept button should always be used, including cases where no relation was found and no label was added (that is, no POS/COMB/NEG).</li>
<li>Only in cases where you want to skip a sentence (e.g. when there is an inherent problem with it) or leave it for a future discussion press on the skip/ignore button</li>
<li>Only for the COMB cases, you should click on the "Get Full Context" button and use it to determine the type of interaction, if possible (otherwise it should indeed be marked as COMB).</li>
<li>An interaction can occur between more than two drugs, if so notice that we don't need each pair from this group to have a marked interaction, as long as they all connect to the same graph.
e.g. "Drugs A, B and C are synergistic." connecting A to B and B to C is sufficient, no need to connect A to C.</li>
<li>In case you reach the conclusion that the interaction is synergistic, ONLY using the context, please check the button stating that the context is required (for the specified relation).</li>
<li>A warning would pop up if you didn't fill up the answers for the context questions (for the relevant labels). Notice for the comb cases, you don't need to answer the context question.</li>
<li>The words that are marked as drugs may be partial. Feel free to add more drugs that are not marked in the sentence. BUT, it is not required to mark a word as drug in order to use it in a relation.</li>
<li>Each interaction should be marked with a different tag (POS1, POS2... for synergistic interactions, and NEG1, NEG2... for negative interactions, and COMB1, COMB2.. for non POS/NEG combinations). We believe that three of each should be sufficient for a given sentence.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<h2>Technical guidelines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>To mark an interaction be sure to be on the Assign-Relations mode/button, then choose the relevant label (e.g. POS1), and press on the participating drugs.</li>
<li>In case you want to use a span of words as a drug, you can merge the words together by pressing the Select Spans button and dragging the mouse to catch the target words.</li>
<li>Your annotations are saved once every 5 examples. So you can go back up to those 5 if you want to undo changes, otherwise contact us to fix it. Alternatively if you want to save and leave you can press Ctrl+s or click on the save button.</li>
<li>When done with an annotation, click the big-green-accept button, then you would be fed with the next annotation.</li>
<li>In case you wish to undo your last accepted or skipped annotation, you can press the big Undo button.</li>
</ol>

<h2>An example for when the context is needed:</h2>
  <h3>Sentence:</h3> <p><i>A total of 647 patients were collected and 330 were administered either standard triple therapy ( ( <b>amoxicillin</b> , <b>clarithromycin</b> , a proton pump inhibitor ) or standard triple therapy plus <b>bismuth tripotassium dicitrate</b> .</i><br/></p>
<h3>Paragraph:</h3> <p><i>A total of 647 patients were collected and 330 were administered either standard triple therapy ( ( amoxicillin , clarithromycin , a proton pump inhibitor ) or standard triple therapy plus bismuth tripotassium dicitrate . Invasive methods is dominates in the initial diagnosis of H. pylori: the frequency of use of the quick urease test decreased from 50% in 2013 to 31% in 2019. Serology was used in 27.9%. There has been an increase in the use of the13C-urea breath test from 13% in 2013 to 31% in 2019. The histological method (7.5%) and the stool antigen test (3.2%) were used less frequently. For eradication control non-invasive methods are mostly used:13C-UDT (82.7%) and the stool antigen test (14.4%). The effectiveness of standard triple therapy (mITT) was 68% with a 7-day course, 79% with a 10-day course, and 70% with a 14-day course. <b>Combination of bismuth and standard triple therapy eradicates H. pylori</b> (mITT) in 63%, 75% and 89%, respectively.</i><br/></p>
    <p>As can be seen it is clear from the context that the tested combination in the sentence was proved to be synergistic in the rest of the context.</p>
