<h2>Goal:</h2>
In this task, you will need to find interactions and classify them. There are three types of classes to classify: SYNergestic, NOT-synergistic (including antagonistic interactinos or interactions that are clearly not synergistic), and lastly UNKnown (including cases where we are not sure if there is an interaction, or cases that we are sure that ther is an interaction but we are not sure what is its polarity).
</p>

<h2>Task guidlines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>It is important for us to get all clearcut positive/negative examples (groups SYN and NOT), whereas we expect only few markings (even one per sentence is sufficient) of the UNK group as they will clearly be much more frequant than the previous groups.</li>
<li> Only for the UNK case, you should click on the "Get Full Context" button and use it to detrmine the type of interaction, if possible.</li>
<li>An interaction can occur between more than two drugs, if so notice that we don't need each pair from this group to have a marked interaction, as long as they all connect to the same graph.
e.g. "Drugs A, B and C are synergistic." connecting A to B and B to C is sufficient, no need to connect A to C.</li>
<li>In case you reach the conclusion that indeed the interaction is synergistic, only using the context, please check the checkbox stating that the context is required (for the specified relation).</li>
<li>The words that are marked as drugs may be partial. Feel free to add more drugs that are not marked in the sentence.</li>
<li>Each interaction should be marked with a different tag (SYN1, SYN2... for synergestic interactions, and NOT1, NOT2... for non synergestic interactions, and UNK1, UNK2.. for unknown interactions). We beleive that tree of each would be sufficient for a given sentence.</li>
<li>If the sentence contained temporal information check the relevant checkbox (for the specified relation).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technical guidlines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>To mark an interaction be sure to be on the Assign-Relations mode/button, them choose the relevant label (e.g. SYN1), and press on the participating drugs.</li>
<li>In case you want to use a span of words as a drug, you can merge the words together by pressing the Select Spans button and dragging the mouse to catch the target words.</li>
<li>Your annotations are saved once every 5 examples. So if you want to undo changes dont wait to long. Alternatively if you want to save and leave you can press Ctrl+s or click on the save button.</li>
<li>When done with an annotation, click the big-green-accept button, then you would be fed with the next annotation.</li>
<li>In case you wish to undo your last accepted or skipped annotation, you can press the big Undo button. In case you want to skip a sentence due to a problem with that setnence simply press on the big skip/ignore button.</li>
</ol>
