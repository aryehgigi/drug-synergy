<h2>Goal:</h2>
In this task, you need to find all synergestic (and non-synergistic) interactions in the given sentence.


<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ol>
<li>We don't need you to mark all instances of a given interaction, but the best one.
e.g. "We wanted to measure the interaction of drugs A and B, and we found that A and B are synergistic, and the synergism of A and B is important". In this case it is sufficient to mark the second or third mention of the synergistic interaction (as the first one is less strong).</li>
<li>An interaction can occur between more than two drugs, if so notice that we don't need each pair from this group to have a marked interaction, as long as they are all connect the the same graph.
e.g. "Drugs A, B and C are synergistic." connecting A to B and B to C is sufficient, no need to connect A to C.</li>
<li>The drug marking is optional and may contain mistakes or missing drugs. Use it as a helper/recommender.</li>
<li>In case you want to connect a span of words as a drug, you can merge the words together by choosing the BLABLA symbol and dragging the mouse to catch the target words.</li>
<li>Each interaction should be marked with a different tag (SYN1, SYN2... for synergestic interactions, and NON1, NON2... for non synergestic interactions).</li>
<li>As we see it, there are three options that come in mind when reading the sentence. The first is when the interaction is certain. The second is that it is certain that no interaction is occuring. The last is when there is an interaction occuring, but it is unclear whether it is synergistic or not.
Only in the last case you should click on the "Get Full Context" button. In case you did and it helped you to reach the conclusion that indeed the interaction is synergistic, please mark the first checkbox - stating that the context is required.</li>
</ol>
