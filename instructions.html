<h2>Goal:</h2>
In this task, you need to find all synergestic (and non-synergistic) interactions in the given sentence.
</div>
<div>
<h2>Task guidlines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>We don't need you to mark all instances of a given interaction, but the best one.
e.g. "We wanted to measure the interaction of drugs A and B, and we found that A and B are synergistic, and the synergism of A and B is important". In this case it is sufficient to mark the second or third mentions of the synergistic interaction (as the first one is less strong).</li>
<li>An interaction can occur between more than two drugs, if so notice that we don't need each pair from this group to have a marked interaction, as long as they all connect to the same graph.
e.g. "Drugs A, B and C are synergistic." connecting A to B and B to C is sufficient, no need to connect A to C.</li>
<li>As we see it, there are three ways an interactions is mentioned in the text. The first is when the interaction is certain. The second is that it is certain that no interaction is occuring or a negative one is occuring. The last is when there is an interaction occuring, but it is unclear whether it is synergistic or not.
Only for the last case, you should click on the "Get Full Context" button and use it to detrmine the type of interaction.</li>
<li>In case you reach the conclusion that indeed the interaction is synergistic, only using the context, please check the first checkbox - stating that the context is required.</li>
<li>The words that are marked as drugs may be partial. Feel free to add more drugs that are not marked in the sentence.</li>
<li>Each interaction should be marked with a different tag (SYN1, SYN2... for synergestic interactions, and NON1, NON2... for non synergestic interactions).</li>
<li>If the sentence contained temporal information check the second checkbox.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technical guidlines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>To mark an interaction be sure to be on the <img src="rel.png"> mode, them choose the relevant label (e.g. SYN1), and press on the participating drugs.</li>
<li>In case you want to use a span of words as a drug, you can merge the words together by pressing the <img src="span.png"> symbol and dragging the mouse to catch the target words.</li>
<li>Your annotations are saved once every 5 examples. So if you want to undo changes dont wait to long. Alternatively if you want to save and leave you can press Ctrl+s or click on the <img src="save.png"> button.</li>
<li>When done with an annotation, click the big-green-accept button, then you would be fed with the next annotation.</li>
<li>In case you wish to undo your last accepted or skipped annotation, you can press the big Undo button. In case you want to skip a sentence due to a problem with that setnence simply press on the big skip/ignore button.</li>
