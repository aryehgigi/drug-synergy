<h2>Goal:</h2>
In this task, you will need to find interactions and classify them. There are three types of classes to classify: SYNergistic, INTeracting (cases that we are sure that there is an interaction but it is unclear whether or not it's synergistic), and lastly NEGative interactions. As summarized in the following table:
<br/>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Interaction description</th>
    <th>Tagging label</th>
    <th>What to annotate</th>
	<th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Synergistic interaction</td>
    <td>SYN</td>
	<td>all</td>
	<td>Using drug A followed by B showed an improved reaction than drug A alone.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Interaction exists but unclear if synergistic</td>
    <td>INT</td>
	<td>all</td>
	<td>We decided to test the combination of drugs A and B, in treatment of C.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not interacting</td>
    <td>-</td>
	<td>Don't annotate</td>
	<td>The following drugs where tested: A, B, C and D, none of which had a significant effect.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Interacting in a Negative manner</td>
    <td>NEG</td>
	<td>all</td>
	<td>Using drugs A and B together increased mortality.</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<h2>Task guidelines:</h2>
<ol>
<li> Only for the INT cases, you should click on the "Get Full Context" button and use it to determine the type of interaction, if possible (otherwise it should indeed be marked as INT).</li>
<li>An interaction can occur between more than two drugs, if so notice that we don't need each pair from this group to have a marked interaction, as long as they all connect to the same graph.
e.g. "Drugs A, B and C are synergistic." connecting A to B and B to C is sufficient, no need to connect A to C.</li>
<li>In case you reach the conclusion that the interaction is synergistic, only using the context, please check the button stating that the context is required (for the specified relation).</li>
<li>If the sentence contained temporal information check the relevant button (for the specified relation).</li>
<li>A warning would pop up if you didn't fill up the answers for the context and temporal questions (for the relevant labels).</li>
<li>The words that are marked as drugs may be partial. Feel free to add more drugs that are not marked in the sentence.</li>
<li>Each interaction should be marked with a different tag (SYN1, SYN2... for synergistic interactions, and NEG1, NEG2... for negative interactions, and INT1, INT2.. for unclear interactions). We believe that tree of each should be sufficient for a given sentence.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technical guidelines:</h2>
<ol>
<li>To mark an interaction be sure to be on the Assign-Relations mode/button, then choose the relevant label (e.g. SYN1), and press on the participating drugs.</li>
<li>In case you want to use a span of words as a drug, you can merge the words together by pressing the Select Spans button and dragging the mouse to catch the target words.</li>
<li>Your annotations are saved once every 5 examples. So if you want to undo changes don't wait too long. Alternatively if you want to save and leave you can press Ctrl+s or click on the save button.</li>
<li>When done with an annotation, click the big-green-accept button, then you would be fed with the next annotation.</li>
<li>In case you wish to undo your last accepted or skipped annotation, you can press the big Undo button. In case you want to skip a sentence due to a problem with that sentence simply press on the big skip/ignore button.</li>
</ol>
