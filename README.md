- agreement1 - first 25 examples of to_annotate/pilot_input * 7 annotators = 175 annotations
- bulk1 - last 175 examples of to_annotate/pilot_input split by 7 annotators - 20 examples not annotated by Yakir = 155 annotations
- agreement2 - 25 examples of to_annotate/pilot2_input_shared * 8 annotators (shaked joined) = 200 annotations
- bulk2 - 300 examples of to_annotate/pilot2_input_split split by 7 annotators = 300 annotations
- bulk3 - next 358 examples of to_annotate/pilot2_input_split split by 7 annotators = 358 annotations
  - yakir's 15 are part of shaked's 100.
  - shaked and yakir in total did 98
  - hagit only di 60
  - we miss 42 examples from the original to_annotate/pilot2_input_split
- agreement3_yakir_yosi(bulk2) - last 25 examples of to_annotate/pilot2_input_split (belonged to yosi on the split task) * 2 annotators (yosi and yakir) = 50 annotations
- agreement4_yakir_yosi(bulk2) - 25 examples (151-175) of to_annotate/pilot2_input_split (belonged to yosi on the split task) * 2 annotators (yosi and yakir) = 50 annotations
- agreement3_fixed - 25 examples doubley annotated in agreement3_yakir_yosi(bulk2) fixed by yosi's arbitration on the disagreements = final 25 examples
- test_set_1 - 75 examples double-annotated by yakir (25 of yuval, 25 of maytal and 25 of hagit) taken from bulk2 and 3 (first 25 of each 100 of the first 300 in the pilot2_input_split)
- test_set_2 - 74 examples double-annotated by shaked (25 of dana_n, 25 of dana_a and 25 of yosi) taken from bulk2 and 3 (first 25 of each 100 of the last 300 in the pilot2_input_split)
  - one of the 75 was emitted because it had only one kind of drug
- test_set_1_gold and test_set_2_gold - are (each) the 75 first-time-annotated taken from bulk2 and 3.
- test_set_1_combined and test_set_2_combined - are (each) 149 of the combined test_set_x + test_set_x_gold
- test_set_1_2_arbitrated - the 149 examples of testset1 and 2 combined. where there was disagreement we used yosi's arbitration to decide from which annotator to take.
- examples_7 - test_set_1_2_arbitrated 149 examples and 25 exampels from agreement3_fixed combined, and converted to model's input format = 149 + 25 = 174
- all_relevant - agreement1 + agreement2 + bulk1(only 75, 25 of each of the best agreement scorers) + bulk2 + bulk3
- examples6_fixed - all_relevant converted to model's input format, except: 11 with one only drug, 16 that got an "ignore"
- bulk4 - 900 new examples from pilot3 minus 16 ignored ones = 884
- examples8 - examples6_fixed + bulk4-converted-to-model's-input without the 150 examples of the text set examples_7 = 756 + 884 - 175 = 1466 examples
