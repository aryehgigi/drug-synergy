Insulin resistance and T2DM was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by high fat diet (HFD) feeding for 60 and for 75 days representing two regimens of the study, protection and treatment. Prophylactic oral administration of curcumin (80 mg/kg), rosiglitazone (1 mg/kg), their combination, or vehicle (in control groups) was started along with HFD feeding in different groups. Treatment is achieved by oral administration of the previously mentioned agents in the last 15 days of HFD feeding after induction of insulin resistance and T2DM in rats. Curcumin showed an anti-hyperglycemic effect and improved insulin sensitivity, and this action may be attributed at least in part to its anti-inflammatory properties as evident by attenuating TNF-\u03b1 levels in HFD fed rats, and its anti-lipolytic effect as evident by attenuating plasma free fatty acids. The curcumin effects are comparable to those of rosiglitazone, which indicate that they may act similarly. Finally we can say that, curcumin could be a beneficial adjuvant therapy in patients with T2DM."}

Paclitaxel is a clinically validated tubulin-targeting agent; however, treatment with paclitaxel is often limited by taxane-related toxicities and is ineffective in tumors with multidrug-resistant cells. Patupilone (EPO906, epothilone B) is a novel non-taxane-related microtubule-stabilizing natural compound that retains full activity in multidrug-resistant tumors and is clinically less toxic than paclitaxel. Here we have investigated the effect of combined treatment with ionizing radiation and patupilone or paclitaxel in the P-glycoprotein-overexpressing, p53-mutated human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW480 and in murine, genetically defined E1A/ras-transformed paclitaxel-sensitive embryo fibroblasts. Patupilone and paclitaxel alone and in combination with ionizing radiation reduced the proliferative activity of the E1A/ras-transformed cell line with similar potency in the sub and low nanomolar range. SW480 cells were only sensitive to patupilone, and combined treatment with low-dose patupilone (0.1 nmol/L) followed by clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation (2 and 5 Gy) resulted in a supra-additive cytotoxic effect. Inhibition of the drug efflux protein P-glycoprotein with verapamil resensitized SW480 cells to treatment with low doses of paclitaxel alone and in combination with IR. In tumor xenografts derived from SW480 cells a minimal treatment regimen with patupilone and fractionated irradiation (1 x 2 mg/kg plus 4 x 3 Gy) resulted in an at least additive tumor response with extended tumor growth arrest. Analysis by flow cytometry in vitro revealed an apoptosis- and G(2)-M-independent mode of radiosensitization by patupilone. Interestingly though, a transient accumulation of cells in S phase was observed on combined treatment.Overall, patupilone might be a promising alternative in paclitaxel-resistant, P-glycoprotein-overexpressing tumors for a combined treatment regimen using ionizing radiation and a microtubule inhibitor."}

The patients had predominantly visceral disease and received a median of two cycles of therapy. Of the 32 evaluable subjects, 15 (47%) achieved a partial response lasting a median of 7 months. Hematological toxicity was generally mild, although there were two episodes of sepsis. One patient developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and one subject developed pulmonary fibrosis, both presumably attributable to treatment with mitomycin C. Another patient died of hepatic failure (hepar lobatum). Thus, there were five patients who sustained life-threatening toxicities; this may have been due to the poor performance status and advanced age of some of the patients. Gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia were minimal. Patient acceptance was high and there was an improvement in symptomatology in the majority of patients. In conclusion, mitomycin C and mitoxantrone chemotherapy is an active drug combination for the treatment of advanced breast cancer that seldom causes significant distressing gastrointestinal side effects or alopecia; however, the duration of response to this regimen appears to be shorter than that obtained with either cyclophosphamide - methotrexate - 5-fluorouracil (CMF) or cyclophosphamide - Adriamycin - 5-fluorouracil (CAF) combination chemotherapy."}

Despite intensive treatment protocols including megatherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the prognosis of NB patients remains poor. More effective therapeutics are required. High vascularity has been described as a feature of aggressive, widely disseminated NB. Our previous work demonstrated the overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in NB, and we showed that an anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2) antibody could induce sustained NB tumor suppression and regression. Sunitinib is a kinase inhibitor targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptors and VEGFRs and, therefore, a promising antiangiogenic agent. In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity of sunitinib and its synergistic cytotoxicity with conventional (cyclophosphamide) and novel (rapamycin) therapies. Both NB cell lines and tumor-initiating cells from patient tumor samples were used in our in vitro and in vivo models for these drug testing. We show that sunitinib inhibits tumor cell proliferation and phosphorylation of VEGFRs. It also inhibits tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in tumor xenograft models. Low-dose sunitinib (20 mg/kg) demonstrates synergistic cytotoxicity with an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, which is more effective than the traditional chemotherapeutic drug, cyclophosphamide. These preclinical studies provide the evidence of antitumor activity of sunitinib both in the early stage of tumor formation and in the progressive metastatic disease. These studies also provide the framework for clinical trial of sunitinib, alone and in combination with conventional and novel therapies to increase efficacy and improve patient outcome in NB."}

A recent pre-clinical study revealed that CPA upregulates dThdPase activity specifically in tumor cells. Furthermore, clinical trials have shown significant response rates in breast cancer patients, when using the chemotherapy combination of 5'-DFUR, CPA and MPA. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of this regimen as a pain reduction therapy for breast cancer patients with bone metastasis. Ten patients who had bone metastasis with restricted ADL were included in the study. All of the patients had had previous exposure to such standard chemotherapy as CAF, CMF, taxol and oral 5-FU administration. The patients were administered daily oral doses of 5'-DFUR at 800-1,200 mg, CPA at 200 mg and MPA at 400-800 mg for two weeks as induction therapy, followed by two weeks rest (one to two cycles). Daily dose of 800 mg of 5'-DFUR, 100 mg of CPA, 400-800 mg of MPA was continuously administered thereafter. The main findings included a significant decrease in pain in eight patients, which continued for more than 6 months. In five patients, the effect lasted more than one year. As the pain decreased, the patients' QOL was improved. Hematological toxicity of more than grade 3 was observed in three patients but only during the induction therapy.

Coculture of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF7 cells with fibroblasts induces tamoxifen and fulvestrant resistance with 4.4 and 2.5-fold reductions, respectively, in apoptosis compared with homotypic MCF7 cell cultures. Treatment of MCF7 cells cultured alone with high-energy mitochondrial \"fuels\" (L-lactate or ketone bodies) is sufficient to confer tamoxifen resistance, mimicking the effects of coculture with fibroblasts. To further demonstrate that epithelial cancer cell mitochondrial activity is the origin of tamoxifen resistance, we employed complementary pharmacological and genetic approaches. First, we studied the effects of two mitochondrial \"poisons,\" namely metformin and arsenic trioxide (ATO), on fibroblast-induced tamoxifen resistance. We show here that treatment with metformin or ATO overcomes fibroblast-induced tamoxifen resistance in MCF7 cells. Treatment with the combination of tamoxifen plus metformin or ATO leads to increases in glucose uptake in MCF7 cells, reflecting metabolic uncoupling between epithelial cancer cells and fibroblasts. In coculture, tamoxifen induces the upregulation of TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator), a p53 regulated gene that simultaneously inhibits glycolysis, autophagy and apoptosis and reduces ROS generation, thereby promoting oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. To genetically mimic the effects of coculture, we next recombinantly overexpressed TIGAR in MCF7 cells. Remarkably, TIGAR overexpression protects epithelial cancer cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, providing genetic evidence that increased mitochondrial function confers tamoxifen resistance. Finally, CAFs also protect MCF7 cells against apoptosis induced by other anticancer agents, such as the topoisomerase inhibitor doxorubicin (adriamycin) and the PARP-1 inhibitor ABT-888. These results suggest that the tumor microenvironment may be a general mechanism for conferring drug resistance. In summary, we have discovered that mitochondrial activity in epithelial cancer cells drives tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer and that mitochondrial \"poisons\" are able to re-sensitize these cancer cells to tamoxifen. In this context, TIGAR may be a key \"druggable\" target for preventing drug resistance in cancer cells, as it protects cancer cells against the onset of stress-induced mitochondrial dys-function and aerobic glycolysis."}

To improve long-term outcomes, new strategies to treat minimal residual tumor burden are needed. Increased total dose delivered can be achieved with two cycles of HDC. Critical design issues include shortening induction chemotherapy to avoid development of drug resistance and the use of different agents for each HDC cycle. We have determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for paclitaxel combined with high-dose melphalan in the context of a double transplant and explored the impact of a short induction phase. Between June 1994 and August 1996, we enrolled 32 women with metastatic BC on to this phase I double transplant trial. Induction consisted of doxorubicin 30 mg/m2/day days 1-3 given for 2 cycles every 14 days with G-CSF 5 microg/kg s.c. days 4-12. Stem cell collection was performed by leukapheresis in each cycle when the WBC recovered to above 1000/microl. Patients with stable disease or better response to induction were eligible to proceed with HDC. HDC regimen I (TxM) included paclitaxel with dose escalation from 0 to 300 mg/m2 given on day 1 and melphalan 180 mg/m2 in two divided doses given on day 3. HDC regimen II was CTCb (cyclophosphamide 6 g/m2, thiotepa 500 mg/m2, and carboplatin 800 mg/m2 total doses) delivered by 96-h continuous infusion. At the first dose level of 150 mg/m2 paclitaxel by 3 h infusion, four of five patients developed dose-limiting toxicity consisting of diffuse skin erythema and capillary leak syndrome. Only two of these five completed the second transplant. Subsequently, paclitaxel was delivered by 24-h continuous infusion together with 96 h of dexamethasone and histamine receptor blockade. This particular toxicity was not observed again. No toxic deaths occurred and dose-limiting toxicity was not encountered. Three patients were removed from study prior to transplant: one for insurance refusal and two for disease progression. All others completed both cycles of transplant. Complete and near complete response (CR/nCR) after completion of therapy was achieved in 23 (72%) of 32 patients. The median EFS is 26 months. The median overall survival has not yet been reached. At a median follow-up of 58 months, EFS and overall survival are 41% and 53%, respectively. This double transplant approach is feasible, safe, and tolerable. Treatment duration is only 14 weeks and eliminates lengthy induction chemotherapy. The observed event-free and overall survivals are promising and are better than expected following a single transplant. Whilst selection biases may in part contribute to this effect, a much larger phase II double transplant trial is warranted in preparation for a potential randomized comparison of standard therapy vs single vs double transplant."}

During this period, there were 62 deaths in the placebo group (8.9%) and 40 in the metoprolol group (5.7%), a mortality reduction of 36% (p less than 0.03). This effect persisted regardless of age, previous infarction or previous chronic beta blockade. All deaths were classified as cardiovascular. After 3 months, all patients were recommended open treatment with metoprolol, and the difference in mortality between the two groups was maintained after 1 year. Early institution of metoprolol (within 12 hours) influenced infarct development during the first 3 days (infarct diagnosis and indirect measures of infarct size). Metoprolol also reduced the incidence on fatal and nonfatal infarction during the next 4-90 days by 35%. Furthermore, fewer episodes of ventricular fibrillation were recorded in the metoprolol than in the placebo group (six vs 17 patients). The tolerance was judged to be very good. The same percentage of patients (19%) was withdrawn from the blind treatment in the two groups. Fewer patients in the metoprolol group used lidocaine, furosemide and analgesics. We conclude that metoprolol therapy instituted on admission in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction reduced 3-month mortality and exerted beneficial clinical effects."}

The tumor is characterized by the presence of EWSR1-ATF1 or EWSR1-CREB1 and immunohistochemical positivity for S-100 protein without melanocytic marker positivity. Due to poor responses to standard sarcoma regimens, GNET has a poor prognosis, and development of effective systemic therapy is desperately needed to treat these patients. Herein, we present a patient with a small bowel GNET who experienced recurrent hepatic and skeletal metastases after a primary resection. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in the course of clinical care with DNA and RNA sequencing demonstrated the presence of an exon 7 to exon 6 EWSR1-CREB1 fusion in the context of a diploid genome with no other genomic alterations.

Although the inhibitor crizotinib, as it blocks the kinase activity of the resulting EML4-ALK fusion protein, displays remarkable initial responses, a fraction of NSCLC cases eventually become resistant to crizotinib by acquiring mutations in the ALK domain or activating bypass pathways via EGFR, KIT, or KRAS. Cancer stem cell (CSC) theory provides a plausible explanation for acquisition of tumorigenesis and resistance. However, the question as to whether EML4-ALK-driven tumorigenesis is linked with the stem-like property and whether the stemness is an effective target in controlling EML4-ALK+ NSCLC including crizotinib-resistant NSCLC cells has not been addressed. Here, we report that stem-like properties stem from ALK activity in EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells. Notably, treatment with rapamycin, a CSC targeting agent, attenuates stem-like phenotypes of the EML4-ALK+ cells, which increased capability of tumor formation and higher expression of stemness-associated molecules such as ALDH, NANOG, and OCT4. Importantly, combinational treatment with rapamycin and crizotinib leads to synergistic anti-tumor effects on EML4-ALK+ NSCLC cells as well as on those resistant to crizotinib. Thus, we provide a proof of principle that targeting stemness would be a novel strategy to control intractable EML4-ALK+ NSCLC. "}

Induction was realized with fentanyl 0.1 mg intravenously followed by ketamine 3 mg.kg-1 intravenously. Anaesthesia was maintained by infusion of ketamine (500 mg in 500 ml of saline solution), nitrous oxide-oxygen (50% each) inhalation and pancuronium or vecuronium. Ketamine infusion was stopped approximately 45 min before operation was completed. Most patients regained consciousness in about 15 to 30 min after nitrous oxide was discontinued.

This study presents for the first time an evaluation of the activity of a representative panel of antibiotics against a large number of A. urinae isolates. The in vitro susceptibilities (MICs) of 56 isolates of A. urinae to 14 antibiotics were determined by agar dilution. In general, A. urinae isolates showed little inter-isolate variability, and had low MICs of penicillin, amoxicillin, piperacillin, cefepime, vancomycin and rifampicin. High-level aminoglycoside resistance was not found for any of the isolates. Moderate to good activity was seen with quinolones, erythromycin and tetracycline. Isolates from two patients with endocarditis were studied with time-kill curves for penicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin. Penicillin and vancomycin alone exhibited slow or no bactericidal activity against the two strains. When combining either penicillin or vancomycin with gentamicin, rapid bactericidal activity was obtained for both strains with both combinations. The treatment options for A. urinae seem to include penicillins for less severe cases. In severe cases, i.e. endocarditis, the time-kill investigations suggest a beneficial effect of combination with gentamicin. In the penicillin-allergic patient vancomycin in combination with gentamicin represents the most obvious alternative."}

A recent combination of 5-FU with oxaliplatin or cetuximab drastically improves the survival rate in CRC patients; however, the toxicity issue cannot be evaded completely. Thus, searching for novel drug combinations with high specificity and low toxicity is seemingly important. Owing to the less undesirable effects of natural products on normal cells, here we investigated the synergistic antitumor effect of withaferin-A (WA) in combination with 5-FU. Our results demonstrate that the combination of WA and 5-FU induces a significant antiproliferative effect and modulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in favor of cell death in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Mechanistically, the combination upregulates the expression of ER stress sensors (BiP, PERK, CHOP, ATF-4, and eIF2\u03b1) and executes PERK axis mediated apoptosis in CRC cells. Additionally, the combined treatment of WA and 5-FU mediated ER stress induces autophagy and apoptosis, which were confirmed by immunoblotting, acridine orange (AO) staining and annexin-V FITC by flow cytometry. In contrast, inhibition of ER stress with salubrinal significantly decreases both autophagic and apoptotic cell populations. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of either autophagy or apoptosis by their respective inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoro-methyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK) decreases their respective population of cells but could not affect either of the population significantly.

Trastuzumab was the first HER2-targeted agent introduced in breast cancer and its introduction led to a change of the natural history of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, which acquired more favourable outcomes due to the efficacy of trastuzumab. In early HER2-positive breast cancer trastuzumab, administered for 1 year according to the international guidelines, significantly improved disease-free survival and distant disease-free survival as compared to non-trastuzumab containing regimens. In metastatic breast cancer, despite some activity as a monotherapy, early addition of trastuzumab to cytotoxic chemotherapy markedly improved both the response rates and the overall survival. First generation studies identified the trastuzumab plus taxane combination as the gold standard for the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients. Second generation studies showed, in combination with chemotherapy, the superiority of dual-blockade of HER2 over trastuzumab alone. Trastuzumab biosimilars showed the same overall response as trastuzumab in the phase 3. Therefore, these trials do support the use of trastuzumab biosimilars for the treatment of brest cancer patients."}

For the combined analysis, at a median follow-up of 18.2 months anastrozole was shown to be superior to tamoxifen in terms of time to progression (TTP; P=0.022) in the hormone receptor-positive subgroup. Both treatments were well tolerated; anastrozole was associated with significantly fewer thromboembolic events (P=0.043) and fewer reports of vaginal bleeding. The survival analyses and safety update in the overall population and in the hormone receptor-positive subgroup from the combined data are now available. At a median follow-up of 43 months, 56.0% of patients in the anastrozole group and 56.1% of patients in the tamoxifen group had died. At the cut-off date, 2-year mortality rates were 31.7 and 32.5% with anastrozole and tamoxifen, respectively, in the overall population. Median time to death (TTD) was similar for both treatments (39 months versus 40 months, respectively; hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, lower 95% confidence limit (CL) 0.84). Similar findings were reported in the hormone receptor-positive population. With longer follow-up, both anastrozole and tamoxifen remained well tolerated. Sequencing data showed that patients crossed from anastrozole to tamoxifen or tamoxifen to anastrozole are similar regarding efficacy. In conclusion, these TTP, survival and tolerability data support the use of anastrozole as a first-line therapy of choice in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer."}

Oral fluoropyrimidines were developed to overcome challenges associated with the IV administration of 5-FU, among which capecitabine has become the most widely used one. However, although capecitabine and other oral fluoropyrimidine-based regimens are more convenient to administer, their efficacy and safety in comparison with IV 5-FU are not well understood. Results from recent randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses have been inconsistent. Safety, in particular, remains controversial. Our review, a first comprehensive meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of cIV 5-FU with capecitabine, the two most widely used fluorouracil modalities in CRC, showed that cIV 5-FU-based regimens are associated with greater response rates compared with capecitabine-based regimens, with no difference in progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, overall survival, or disease-free survival between the two. Furthermore, cIV 5-FU-based regimens showed an improved safety profile compared with capecitabine-based regimens. Our findings suggest that cIV 5-FU remains a more effective and safer modality of fluorouracil administration than capecitabine, thus providing supporting evidence to guide clinical practice in the management of colorectal cancer."}

In this context, conditional promoters are useful tools, because they may be induced by therapeutic modalities. The human multidrug resistance gene (mdr1) promoter is inducible by cytostatic drugs and can be employed for the chemotherapy-regulated expression of therapeutic genes. In this in vivo study, the human mdr1 promoter fragment (-207 to +158) was used for drug-inducible expression of human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the vector construct pM3mdr-p-hTNF. The single doxorubicin and vincristine treatment of nude mice xenografted with pM3mdr-p-hTNF-transduced MCF-7 mammary tumors resulted in drug-induced and time-dependent elevation of intratumoral TNF-alpha expression at the mRNA and protein level. The highest drug induction was achieved at 2 days after drug application, as reflected by a maximum 25-fold increase in TNF-alpha secretion in the tumor. This drug-induced TNF-alpha expression is more effective in inhibiting tumor growth compared with the growth of tumors transduced with constitutively TNF-alpha-expressing vectors in combination with chemotherapy."}

New information on the inflammatory component of OA and the cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors has prompted efforts to revise the current recommendations for the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of patients with OA. Clinical studies have shown that naproxen and ibuprofen are significantly more effective at reducing OA pain than is acetaminophen, the traditional first-line therapy, which has no apparent anti-inflammatory activity in the joints. The theoretical advantage of COX-2-specific inhibitors in reducing gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity has been demonstrated by clinical studies. GI complications can be reduced by using lower NSAID doses for the shortest duration or with a concomitant proton-pump inhibitor. All prescription NSAIDs carry a black box warning regarding CV risks; these risks vary among the NSAIDs. While ibuprofen and diclofenac are associated with an increased CV risk, naproxen was associated with a neutral CV risk relative to placebo. Ibuprofen, but not naproxen, attenuates the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. An understanding of the risks and benefits is important when choosing an NSAID. An exhaustive search of the medical literature since 1990 was conducted using the words \"ibuprofen,\" \"naproxen,\" \"COX-2-specific NSAIDs,\" \"nonspecific NSAIDs,\" \"low-dose aspirin,\" and \"nonprescription dosage.\" Databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCISEARCH.

In this study, we examined in hypertensive patients uncontrolled by the combination treatment with 5 mg amlodipine plus 80 mg valsartan or 8 mg candesartan whether additional BP lowering could be achieved by switching to 5 mg amlodipine plus 40 mg telmisartan. Forty-seven patients with essential hypertension who failed to achieve a target BP level by the treatment of 5 mg amlodipine plus 80 mg valsartan or 8 mg candesartan for at least 2 months were enrolled. Replacement of valsartan or candesartan by telmisartan showed a significant reduction in both mean clinic systolic and diastolic BP at 4, 8 and 12 weeks; BP level decreased from 143.7/82.3 mmHg at baseline to 135.4/77.5 mmHg at 12 weeks.

Paclitaxel increases the area under the curve of DOX by approximately 30% when given before or after DOX, providing an explanation for this phenomenon. Several strategies seem to be associated with a reduced incidence of cardiac toxicity, including the use of dexrazoxane with the combination, restricting the cumulative DOX dose to < or = 360 mg/m2, increasing the interval between administration of the drugs, and use of other taxanes (eg, docetaxel) or other less cardiotoxic anthracyclines (eg, epirubicin or liposomal DOX).

The pharmacokinetics of valproate during the interval between doses was determined using a gas chromatographic technique. The clinical effect of the treatment was assessed by interviewing the parents. The plasma concentrations showed considerable fluctuation during the intervals between doses. The mean increase from pre-administration to peak level was 82% when the dose interval was 12 h, and 62% when it was 8 h. The mean plasma half-life of valproate, using a one-compartment model, was 10.9 +/- 1.3 h (mean +/- SD). The plasma half-life of valproate was decreased when the drug was combined with the other anti-epileptics. The calculated area under the concentration versus time curve was linearly related to dose, both in a single patient on four dose levels and when different patients were compared. The clinical effect of valproate monotherapy was best in patients with absences, usually good in myoclonus and less favourable in other types of epilepsy. For children with absences, the optimal dose range of valproate was between 20 and 40 mg/kg/24 h. In comparison, the myoclonic types of epilepsy needed a slightly higher dose level, between 30 and 60 mg/kg/24 h. In the latter group a \"therapeutic window\" seems to exist, since patients below and above the suggested dose levels were not well-controlled. Therapeutic monitoring of valproate does not appear meaningful when the drug is used as monotherapy. However, in combination therapy, determination of the plasma levels of all anti-convulsants used may be helpful. The large fluctuations of valproate during a dose interval must be taken into consideration when the clinical effects are analysed."}

In this review, the structure and signalling properties of the RET proto-oncogene in its wild-type and mutant forms, and its role in hereditary and sporadic MTC, are discussed. A full data search was performed through PubMed over the years 2000-2008 with the key words 'medullary thyroid cancer, treatment, molecular biology, RET, molecular mechanism', and all relevant publications have been included, together with selected publications prior to that date. We also review novel therapies for metastatic MTC, especially the tyrosine kinase inhibitors which have activity at multiple receptor subtypes, and summarize the current ongoing trials in this area. While such tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly those affecting RET activity such as vandetanib, sorafenib and sunitinib, are promising, the low rate of partial responses and absence of complete responses in all of the various trials of monotherapy emphasize the need for new and more effective single agents or combinations of therapeutic agents with acceptable toxicity."}

Unlike B-precursor ALL, most investigators are still using cranial radiation (CRT) and are hesitant to rely solely on intrathecal therapy for T-ALL. In this study we assessed the effects of CRT upon event-free survival and central nervous system (CNS) relapses in a cohort of children with high risk features of T cell leukemia. In a series of six consecutive studies (1987-1995) patients were non-randomly assigned their CNS prophylaxis per individual protocol. These protocols were based on POG 8704 which relied on rotating drug combinations (cytarabine/cyclophosphamide, teniposide/Ara-C, and vincristine/doxorubicin/6-MP/prednisone) postinduction. Modifications such as high-dose cytarabine, intermediate-dose methotrexate, and the addition of G-CSF, were designed to give higher CNS drug levels (decreasing the need for CRT), to eliminate epidophyllotoxin (decreasing the risk of secondary leukemia), and to reduce therapy-related neutropenia (pilot studies POG 9086, 9295, 9296, 9297, 9398). All patients included in this analysis qualified for POG high risk criteria, WBC >50000/mm3 and/or CNS leukemia. Patients without CNS involvement received 16 doses of age-adjusted triple intra-thecal therapy (TIT = hydrocortisone, MTX, and cytarabine) whereas patients with CNS disease received three more doses of TIT during induction and consolidation. Patients who received CRT were treated with 2400 cGy (POG 8704) or 1800 cGy (POG 9086 and 9295). CNS therapy included CRT in 144 patients while the remaining 78 patients received no radiation by original protocol design. There were 155 males and 57 females with a median age of 8.2 years. The median WBC for the CRT+ and CRT- patients were 186000/mm3 and 200000/mm3, respectively. CNS involvement at diagnosis was seen in 16% of the CRT+ and 23% of the CRT- groups. The complete continuous remission rate (CCR) was not significantly different for the irradiated vs. non-irradiated groups (P = 0.46). The 3-year event-free survival was 65% (s.e. 6%) and 63% (s.e. 4%) for the non-irradiated vs. the radiated group. However, the 3-year CNS relapse rate was significantly higher amongst patients who did not receive CRT; 18% (s.e. 5%) vs. 7% (s.e. 3%) in the irradiated group (P = 0.012). Our analysis in a non-randomized setting, suggests that CRT did not significantly correlate with event-free survival but omitting it had an adverse effect on the CNS involvement at the time of relapse."}

Bleomycin, which halts cell cycle progression at G2 phase, is an agent which might thereby increase taxane cytotoxicity. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of different paclitaxel-platinum or paclitaxel-bleomycin schedules on cytotoxicity in human NSCLC and ovarian cancer cells. The simultaneous combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin exhibited simple additivity in vitro, while sequential exposure studies indicated that carboplatin followed by paclitaxel produced greater than additive cytotoxicity using the isobologram analysis of combinatorial effects. In contrast, the simultaneous combination of paclitaxel and bleomycin consistently exhibited greater than additive effects indicating a potentially synergistic combination. Sequential exposure studies of bleomycin followed by paclitaxel produced similar synergistic findings. Experiments in SCID mice evaluating the combinations of paclitaxel and bleomycin supported the in vitro results, as significantly enhanced A549 lung tumor growth inhibition was observed when paclitaxel was administered 1 h after bleomycin. The synergistic activity shown by the combination of bleomycin and paclitaxel indicates a potentially beneficial novel combination for treatment of NSCLC and ovarian cancer."}

The anti-neoplastic therapy of advanced NET disease is still unsatisfactory and innovative therapeutic approaches are needed. As NET frequently express insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their receptors (IGFR), known to promote survival, oncogenic transformation, tumour growth and spreading, the inhibition of the IGF/IGF-receptor system may offer possibilities for novel targeted treatment strategies of NET. Here, we studied the anti-neoplastic effects of an inhibition of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-1R) signalling in NET cells by the novel IGF-1R tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor NVP-AEW541, whose anti-neoplastic potency has not yet been tested in NET disease. Using two human NET cell lines with different growth characteristics, we demonstrated that NVP-AEW541 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of NET cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Anti-neoplastic effects of NVP-AEW541 were also detected in primary cultures of human neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumours. Apoptosis was characterized by activation of the apoptotic key enzyme, caspase-3, as well as by detection of changes in the expression of the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, BAX and Bcl-2, after NVP-AEW541 treatment. Cell cycle was arrested at the G1/S checkpoint. The anti-neoplastic effects of NVP-AEW541 involved the inactivation of ERK1/2. Induction of immediate cytotoxicity did not account for the anti-neoplastic effects of NVP-AEW541, as shown by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release. Moreover, additive anti-neoplastic effects were observed when NVP-AEW541 was combined with cytostatics such as doxorubicin or the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, fluvastatin. This is the first report on the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by the IGF-1R-TK inhibitor, NVP-AEW541, in NET cells. The inhibition of the IGF/IGFR system appears to be a promising novel approach for future treatment strategies of NET disease."}

Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed ED-SCLC received irinotecan (60 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15) plus carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1) every 4 weeks. Treatment was repeated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 6 cycles. Forty-four patients were enrolled. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate (RR) was 75% (8 complete responses and 25 partial responses). The median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 5.6 and 8.7 months, respectively. The principle toxicities were neutropenia and diarrhea. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 30% of the patients and 7% of patients presented with febrile neutropenia. Grade 3-4 diarrhea occurred in 21% of the patients. A subgroup consisting of patients \u2265 65 years of age had outcomes similar to the younger group <65 years of age. The objective RR was 72% in the patients <65 years of age and 77% in the patients \u2265 65 years of age (P = .738). The median PFS and OS (<65 years vs. \u2265 65 years) were 5.3 vs. 5.6 months (P = .835) and 9.0 vs. 8.7 months (P = .648), respectively. The combination of irinotecan and carboplatin is active and tolerable in patients with ED-SCLC. This regimen could be considered as a treatment option for patients of advanced age."}

Preclinically, estramustine combined with other microtubule inhibitors, like vinblastine or paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ), produced additive or greater antimitotic and cytotoxic effects. Clinically, the estramustine/vinblastine combination has significant activity in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. We have begun a phase I study of paclitaxel by 96-hour continuous infusion every 3 weeks combined with daily oral estramustine (600 mg/m2). Eighteen patients with refractory solid tumors have received paclitaxel doses ranging from 80 to 140 mg/m2. Grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia occurred in one of seven and two of four patients treated at the 120- and 140-mg/m2 dose levels, respectively. The latter two patients experienced grade 3 mucositis and had mean plasma paclitaxel levels exceeding 0.1 mumol/L. Other toxicities, principally nausea and hepatic function abnormalities, have been mild. The apparent steady-state concentrations of paclitaxel 100 and 120 mg/m2 administered with estramustine are similar to those reported for single-agent paclitaxel administered as a 96-hour infusion at doses of 100 and 120 mg/m2. In contrast, at the 140 mg/m2 dose level, paclitaxel concentrations increased throughout the infusion, and steady state was not reached in three of the four patients treated. Objective responses have been observed in two of three patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and in two patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer and measurable soft tissue metastases. Two additional patients with prostate cancer have been treated with the estramustine/paclitaxel combination, one achieving a major response and the other stable disease. The recommended phase II dose for 96-hour infusional paclitaxel with daily oral estramustine is at least 120 mg/m2. Studies to determine the effect of estramustine on paclitaxel pharmacokinetics are continuing. The antitumor activity observed merits phase II studies of this combination in hormone-resistant prostate cancer and other malignancies."}

Differences in susceptibility dependent on the medium were seen with macrolides, tetracycline, fosfomycin and some beta-lactams. The natural antibiotic susceptibility patterns suggest novel species-specific mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Uncharacterized species-specific aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and multidrug efflux systems affecting tetracyclines, quinolones and chloramphenicol are probably responsible for some of the phenotypes observed. The natural amoxicillin sensitivity of several strains of some species combined with natural resistance to some narrow-spectrum cephalosporins indicate the expression of naturally occurring beta-lactamases with unique substrate profiles. beta-Lactamases of representative strains of each species were characterized phenotypically and genotypically.

Two newly introduced pharmaceutical mixtures of amlodipine/celecoxib and amlodipine/ramipril were developed to manage hypertension and the associated osteoarthritis. The current work presents three newly developed UV spectrophotometric methods depending on minimal mathematical manipulations on the zero-order spectrum namely: absorption correction, induced dual-wavelength, and Fourier self deconvoluted method; for the simultaneous determination of celecoxib and ramipril in their pharmaceutical combined dosage forms with amlodipine. In absorption correction and induced dual-wavelength method, celecoxib and ramipril were determined at 253 and 222\u00a0nm for absorption correction and (251-270\u00a0nm) and (222-230\u00a0nm) for induced dual-wavelength method, respectively from the zero-order spectrum after calculating the absorption correction and equality factors for amlodipine. Amlodipine itself was determined at 361\u00a0nm from the zero-order spectrum in both methods. In Fourier self deconvoluted method, celecoxib and amlodipine zero-order spectra were deconvoluted, using the spectrophotometer software built-in Fourier wavelet function, and then was determined at 360 and 269\u00a0nm, respectively. The proposed methods were simple, accurate, and sensitive requiring minimal mathematical manipulations saving the time needed for analysis. The methods were linear over the range of (5-60\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), (5-30\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), and (5-110\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for each of amlodipine, celecoxib, and ramipril, respectively.

The median cumulative docetaxel dose was 462 mg/m (range 199-600) and that of epirubicin 476 mg/m (range 199-740). The overall response rate was 54% (95% CI 37-71), with a median duration of response of 14.8 months (95% CI 8.8-27.8). Median time to progression was 12 months, median survival 26 months. Neutropenia below 0.5 x 10 /l occurred following 113 (39%) of the total of 285 cycles given; 21 patients (55%) were hospitalized for febrile neutropenia.

We decided to assess the effect of several chemotherapeutic agents on placental development by using in vitro culture of human term cytotrophoblasts. Methods Cytotrophoblasts isolated from term placentas were cultured for 48\u00a0h and treated for 24\u00a0h with epirubicin, docetaxel, vinblastine, methotrexate, tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and endoxifen. First, cell viability was assessed. Then, the effect of the treatment on trophoblast differentiation and placental angiogenesis was assessed by quantifying hCG and PlGF mRNA and protein expression. Finally, the expression of two efflux transporters, BCRP and MDR1 was investigated. Results Epirubicin only strongly decreased cell viability. Epirubicin, docetaxel, and vinblastine inhibited HCGB and PlGF expression while methotrexate, tamoxifen and its two metabolites increased it. BCRP was essentially expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts and MDR1 in undifferentiated cytotrophoblasts. Their expression was not affected by the drugs but vinblastine increased BCRP mRNA expression by 2.8-fold. Discussion The most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs are well supported in vitro by syncytiotrophoblasts, except for epirubicin, which was very cytotoxic. Chemotherapy perturbed the expression of genes normally upregulated during placental differentiation and angiogenesis but not the expression of the drug transporters. Further studies looking at the effect of combination therapy and the transporter capacities to reject the drugs will be needed to better define the effects of chemotherapy on placental development and function."}

High antiadhesion effect was observed with cimetidine, warfarin and acetylsalicylic acid. Low-molecular-weight heparins had a small antiadhesion effect in independent use. In combination with cimetidine, a potential effect of cimetidine on the antiadhesion was observed. The antiadhesion effect was dependent on the type of the cancer cell line. Different effects between cell lines BT 549 and MDA 231 were observed. The strongest antiadhesion effect was obtained using the combination of cimetidine with acetylsalicylic acid. In the majority of applications of the drugs and their combinations, a proportional antiadhesion effect was dependent on the concentration and time. We suppose that anticoagulant drugs might have higher antimetastatic effect in combination with cimetidine. The choice of anticoagulants can decrease the adhesion, decrease tumor angiogenesis and cause the shortening of blood clotting time. Cimetidine can decrease the adhesion of cancer cells and increase the activity of NK cells. Indeed, according to our results, application of cimetidine and anticoagulant drugs intensifies the antiadhesion effect together with other antimetastatic effects."}

Drugs are approved using an average dose for an ideal average patient, but pharmacologists have described outliers: genetic poor metabolizers (PMs) and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs). Environmental and personal variables can also make patients behave as PMs or UMs. Drug clearance is represented by the concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio under steady-state and trough conditions. A very low C/D ratio indicates a UM, while a very high C/D ratio indicates a PM. Total risperidone C/D ratio for the oral formulation is around 7\u202fng/ml per mg/day and can be influenced by CYP2D6 polymorphism, DDIs with inducers and inhibitors, and renal function. Oral paliperidone has low availability; its C/D ratio is around 4.1\u202fng/ml per mg/d and can be influenced by inducers and renal impairment. Once-a-month long-acting paliperidone provides a C/D ratio around 7.7\u202fng/ml per mg/day at steady state, which is expected to be in the 8th month (before the 9th injection). TDM is particularly important for long-acting paliperidone formulations that may accumulate once steady state is reached (after years for the 3- and 6-month formulations).

Clinically, paclitaxel appears to be noncross-resistant with doxorubicin, but the unique and overlapping toxicities of these three agents might preclude concurrent adjuvant administration. A possible solution is sequential rather than concurrent administration, an approach that kinetic modelling predicts to be superior. A pilot study testing dose-intensive sequential administration of doxorubicin/paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide enrolled 42 patients with a median age of 42 years who had resected breast cancer metastatic to four or more ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. Intravenous treatment, given at 14-day intervals, began with three cycles of doxorubicin 90 mg/m2, followed by three cycles of paclitaxel 250 mg/m2, given as a 24-hour infusion, and, finally, three cycles of cyclophosphamide 3 g/m2. Selected patients received radiotherapy. The median number of positive lymph nodes was eight (range, four to 25), and the median tumor size was 3.0 cm (range, 0 to 11.0 cm).

Consequently, a chemical method of adrenal suppression was developed using a potent inhibitor of adrenal steroid synthesis, aminoglutethimide, in combination with a synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. While this regimen effectively blocked adrenal function, it was complicated by a drug interaction in which aminoglutethimide accelerated the metabolism and reduced the bioavailability of dexamethasone. To overcome this problem, a new regime using aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone, a glucocorticoid less susceptible to altered metabolism, was developed. Kinetic studies confirmed that aminoglutethimide does not interact with hydrocortisone to alter its rate of metabolism. Hormone measurements established that 1000 mg of aminoglutethimide and 40 mg of hydrocortisone daily suppressed DHA-sulfate, androstenedione, estrone, estradiol and aldosterone to a greater extent than the prior protocol using aminoglutethimide and 2-3 mg of dexamethasone. Patients experienced objective tumor regression with equal frequency while receiving the aminoglutethimide-hydrocortisone regimen or aminoglutethimide and dexamethasone and the overall rate of response in 50 evaluable patients was 38%. Side effects occurred frequently in the first few weeks of treatment but disappeared nearly uniformly thereafter. The present aminoglutethimide-hydrocortisone regimen is simple, non-toxic, effective in inhibiting estradiol synthesis and capable of inducing tumor regression as frequently as previously reported with adrenalectomy."}

The activity found in both test systems indicates a promising antithrombotic potential for etofylline clofibrate and warrants further investigation in humans."}

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their anti-inflammatory metabolites lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins and maresins have a significant role in obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic syndrome and cancer. We observed that PUFAs (especially arachidonic acid, AA) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) protect against the cytotoxic actions of alloxan, streptozotocin, benzo(a)pyrene (BP) and doxorubicin. Thus, there is an overlap in the beneficial actions of resveratrol, PUFAs and BDNF suggesting that these molecules may interact and augment synthesis and action of each other. This is supported by the observation that resveratrol and PUFAs modulate gut microbiota and influence stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Since resveratrol is not easily absorbed from the gut it is likely that it may act on endocannabinoid and light, odor, and taste receptors located in the gut, which, in turn, convey their messages to the various organs via vagus nerve."}

To build on this therapy, we have evaluated the combination of irinotecan given on this schedule with 5-fluorouracil given on days 1, 7, and 14 with or without leucovorin [(dx5)3 i.v.] against colon tumors, or combined with etoposide administered (dx5)2 i.v. either 2 h before or 2 h after irinotecan for treatment of colon tumors and rhabdomyosarcomas. A combination of 5-fluorouracil at 75% and irinotecan at 50% of their respective maximum tolerated doses when administered as single agents on this schedule gave acceptable toxicity. Against colon adenocarcinoma xenografts, 5-fluorouracil did not enhance the response rate compared with that obtained with the optimum dose of irinotecan given as a single agent. Against GC3/TK- xenografts, which lack thymidine kinase and cannot salvage thymidine to circumvent the inhibition of thymidylate synthase, the addition of leucovorin to the combination increased the complete response rate from 10 to >90%, whereas the response rates for the optimal doses of irinotecan or 5-fluorouracil, as single agents, were 30 and <10%, respectively. Etoposide d x 5 i.v. for two or three courses or (d x 5)3 p.o. did not cause objective regression of any colon tumors. In contrast, three of five rhabdomyosarcoma lines demonstrated a high frequency of partial regressions or complete regressions when treated (d x 5)1 i.v. Repetitive courses [e.g., (d x 5)2 or (d x 5)3] i.v. or p.o. or by 4-h infusion d x3 i.v. were either equally effective or less effective. Irinotecan and etoposide were combined using the (d x 5)2 i.v. schedule for both drugs, in which irinotecan was given 2 h before or 2 h after the administration of etoposide. Each drug could be combined at only 38% of its respective maximum tolerated dose when administered as a single agent, indicating greater than additive toxicity. Toxicity was similar irrespective of the sequence of administration and was manifested by loss of weight (73% of the initial weight, nadir day 7), myelosuppression, and prolonged thrombocytopenia. The responses of colon carcinomas to the combination given in either sequence were similar to that achieved with irinotecan given alone at the same dose as used in the combination. Similarly, when etoposide was given before irinotecan, the responses of rhabdomyosarcomas were similar to those for irinotecan. However, in experiments in which etoposide was administered 2 h after each dose of irinotecan, there was significant antagonism of the antitumor activity of irinotecan."}

One study compared the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone in combination with deferoxamine. Three three-arm studies compared deferasirox to deferoxamine and deferiprone (two studies) or the combination of deferasirox and deferiprone to deferiprone and deferasirox monotherapy respectively (one study). One four-arm study compared two different doses of deferasirox to matching placebo groups.The two studies (a pharmacokinetic and a dose-escalation study) comparing deferasirox to placebo (n = 47) in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia showed that deferasirox leads to net iron excretion. In these studies, safety was acceptable and further investigation in phase II and phase III studies was warranted.Nine studies (1251 participants) provided data for deferasirox versus standard treatment with deferoxamine. Data suggest that a similar efficacy can be achieved depending on the ratio of doses of deferoxamine and deferasirox being compared. In the phase III study, similar or superior efficacy for the intermediate markers ferritin and liver iron concentration (LIC) could only be achieved in the highly iron-overloaded subgroup at a mean ratio of 1 mg of deferasirox to 1.8 mg of deferoxamine corresponding to a mean dose of 28.2 mg per day and 51.6 mg per day respectively. The pooled effects across the different dosing ratios are: serum ferritin, mean difference (MD) 454.42 ng/mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 337.13 to 571.71) (moderate quality evidence); LIC evaluated by biopsy or SQUID, MD 2.37 mg Fe/g dry weight (95% CI 1.68 to 3.07) (moderate quality evidence) and responder analysis, LIC 1 to < 7 mg Fe/g dry weight, risk ratio (RR) 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.92) (moderate quality evidence). The substantial heterogeneity observed could be explained by the different dosing ratios. Data on mortality (low quality evidence) and on safety at the presumably required doses for effective chelation therapy are limited. Patient satisfaction was better with deferasirox among those who had previously received deferoxamine treatment, RR 2.20 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.57) (moderate quality evidence). The rate of discontinuations was similar for both drugs (low quality evidence).For the remaining comparisons in people with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, the quality of the evidence for outcomes assessed was low to very low, mainly due to the very small number of participants included. Four studies (205 participants) compared deferasirox to deferiprone; one of which (41 participants) revealed a higher number of participants experiencing arthralgia in the deferiprone group, but due to the large number of different types of adverse events reported and compared this result is uncertain. One study (96 participants) compared deferasirox combined with deferiprone to deferiprone with deferoxamine. Participants treated with the combination of the oral iron chelators had a higher adherence compared to those treated with deferiprone and deferoxamine, but no participants discontinued the study. In the comparisons of deferasirox versus combined deferasirox and deferiprone and that of deferiprone versus combined deferasirox and deferiprone (one study, 40 participants), and deferasirox and deferoxamine versus deferoxamine alone (one study, 94 participants), only a few patient-relevant outcomes were reported and no significant differences were observed.One study (166 participants) included people with non-transfusion dependent thalassaemia and compared two different doses of deferasirox to placebo.

A phase II trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of vinorelbine (VNB), mitomycin C (MMC), and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in advanced breast cancer. Between October 1992 and July 1994, 55 patients entered this trial. Nine patients had locally advanced disease and 46 had distant metastases, including 14 who had received previous palliative chemotherapy with (n = 9) or without anthracyclines (n = 5). Therapy consisted of VNB 40-50 mg m(-2) diluted in 250 ml saline infused over 30 min every 3 weeks, and MMC 15 mg m(-2) administered by intravenous bolus injection every 6 weeks. G-CSF was given at 5 microg kg(-1) day(-1) subcutaneously from days 2 to 7 following each cytotoxic drug administration. Treatment was continued in case of response or stable disease for a total of six courses. The overall response rate was 73% for all 55 patients (95% confidence interval, 59-84%), including 12 (22%) complete response (CR) and 28 (51%) partial response (PR); 13 patients (24%) had stable disease (SD), and only two (4%) progressed. All nine patients with locally advanced disease were rated responsive (two pCR, seven PR) and underwent surgery with curative intent. Eight out of nine remain disease free after a median observation period of 18 months (range, 13.5-28 months). Among the 32 previously untreated patients with metastatic disease, nine (28%) achieved CR, 15 PR (47%), seven SD (22%) and one PD (3%). Second-line chemotherapy with this regimen resulted in 7/14 (50%) objective remissions (one CR, six PR), six had SD and one PD. The median time to progression was 12 months (range, 2-24+ months) in previously untreated patients with disseminated disease, and 6.0 months (range, 2-22 months) in those who had failed prior chemotherapy. After a median follow-up time of 20 months, 24 patients with distant metastases are still alive with disease; median survival has not been reached yet. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression: six (11%) and ten patients (18%) had World Health Organization grade 3, and eight (14%) and nine patients (16%) had grade 4 leucopenia and granulocytopenia respectively. Severe (WHO grade 3) non-haematological toxicities included nausea/vomiting in 7%, constipation in 9%, peripheral neuropathy in 5%, infectious episodes in 7%, phlebitis due to drug extravasation in 5%, alopecia in 9%, and acute reversible pulmonary toxicity in 11%. Our data suggest that vinorelbine, mitomycin C plus G-CSF has an excellent anti-tumour activity in advanced breast cancer, probably superior to most other available combination chemotherapy regimens. This combination does not seem to present significant cross-resistance with previous CMF or anthracycline regimens. Apart from reversible, acute pulmonary toxicity, a rare adverse reaction that had previously been described for VNB, as well as the combination of natural vinca alkaloids with mitomycin C, and few episodes of grade 3 neurotoxicity (all of which occurred at the initial 50 mg m(-2) VNB dose level), the tolerance of this regimen seems acceptable and justifies further evaluation in front-line and salvage therapy of advanced breast cancer."}

Detection of free radicals in biological systems is challenging due to their short half-lives. We have applied electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy combined with spin traps using the probes PBN (N-tert-butyl-\u03b1-phenylnitrone) and DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) to assess free radical formation in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus treated with a bactericidal antibiotic, vancomycin or ciprofloxacin. While we were unable to detect ESR signals in bacterial cells, hydroxyl radicals were observed in the supernatant of bacterial cell cultures. Surprisingly, the strongest signal was detected in broth medium without bacterial cells present and it was mitigated by iron chelation or by addition of catalase, which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. This suggests that the signal originates from hydroxyl radicals formed by the Fenton reaction, in which iron is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide. Previously, hydroxyl radicals have been proposed to be generated within bacterial cells in response to bactericidal antibiotics. We found that when S. aureus was exposed to vancomycin or ciprofloxacin, hydroxyl radical formation in the broth was indeed increased compared to the level seen with untreated bacterial cells. However, S. aureus cells express catalase, and the antibiotic-mediated increase in hydroxyl radical formation was correlated with reduced katA expression and catalase activity in the presence of either antibiotic. Therefore, our results show that in S. aureus, bactericidal antibiotics modulate catalase expression, which in turn influences the formation of free radicals in the surrounding broth medium. If similar regulation is found in other bacterial species, it might explain why bactericidal antibiotics are perceived as inducing formation of free radicals. "}

Specifically monitored were the effects of therapy on blood pressure and pulse, renal function, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide therapy produced excellent control of blood pressure with no adverse side effects. After approximately 8 weeks of therapy, renal vascular resistance was decreased and no adverse effects on glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow were noted, except in one patient with a functional unilateral stenotic kidney. Patients receiving enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide showed stimulation of plasma renin activity and suppression of plasma angiotensin II, although the initial degree of suppression was not sustained in all patients during prolonged therapy.

We have now extended our investigations to determine whether such selective reductions in tumor blood flow induced by hydralazine can increase the tumor cytotoxicity of other classes of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Our initial studies have involved the alkylating agent melphalan. Administration of hydralazine (5 mg/kg IP) at various times before or after melphalan results in increased tumor cytotoxicity in the Lewis lung carcinoma. An enhancement factor of between 2 and 3 was obtained in this tumor system. Similar results are observed if the vasodilator cadralazine is used. In contrast to the enhancement of the tumor cytotoxicity of melphalan by hydralazine, systemic toxicity is only increased by a factor of 1.2. Therefore, therapeutic gain may accrue from the use of vasodilating agents in combination with melphalan. Studies using spheroids to establish the mechanism responsible for the enhanced tumor cytotoxicity indicate that both hypoxia and pH can influence melphalan toxicity."}

The increase in drug resistance and invasion caused by biofilm formation brings enormous challenges to the management of Candida infection.

The spectrophotometric method and the XTT {2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide} reduction assay used for data generation make it possible to evaluate fungal biofilm growth accurately. The combined use of the most commonly used methods, the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) and a newly developed method, the \u0394E model, which uses the concentration-effect relationship over the whole concentration range instead of using the MIC index alone, makes the interpretation of results more reliable. As an attractive tool for studying the pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents, time-kill curves can provide detailed information about antimicrobial efficacy as a function of both time and concentration. In the present study, in vitro interactions between aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) and amphotericin B (AMB) against planktonic cells and biofilm cells of Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis were evaluated by the checkerboard microdilution method and the time-kill test. Synergistic and indifferent effects were found for the combination of ASA and AMB against planktonic cells, while strong synergy was found against biofilm cells analyzed by FICI. The \u0394E model gave more consistent results with FICI. The positive interactions in concentration were also confirmed by the time-kill test. Moreover, this approach also revealed the pharmacodynamics changes of ASA and synergistic action on time. Our findings suggest a potential clinical use for combination therapy with ASA and AMB to augment activity against biofilm-associated infections."}

CT angiogram showed thickening of the terminal ileum, wall thickening and narrowing of multiple large and medium arteries including aorta and left common carotid. Colonoscopy with biopsy of the stenotic ileocecal valve confirmed CD. Resected carotid artery pathology was consistent with TA. Treatment was initially begun with prednisone, then methotrexate was started followed by infliximab. Due to side effects, methotrexate was switched to azathioprine. He remained asymptomatic. Case 2: A 38-year-old male with well-characterized Crohn's ileocolitis for 15 years, who had been treated with prednisone, mesalamine, sulfasalazine, and azathioprine presented with chest, upper back and abdominal pain. CT angiogram showed vasculitis of large and medium arteries, with stenosis of the right renal artery, and wall thickening of the sigmoid colon. He was diagnosed with TA. He underwent treatment with infliximab and adalumimab on different occasions, which were later discontinued due to fever, bacteremia and complications from sepsis. He remained on prednisone and azathioprine. In these two patients with both CD and TA the diagnoses were confirmed by imaging and pathologic findings. Both patients developed vascular complications. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy was effective in one patient but discontinued in the other due to infection. Further research into the association of CD and TA may provide clues to their etiologies and guide effective interventions."}

The most important factors that determine therapy are disease extent and severity. 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) constitute the treatment of choice in mild-to-moderate UC. The efficacy of new compounds (e.g. mesalazine) is only mildly improved compared to sulphasalazine; however, their use has become more frequent due to a more favorable side effects profile. Topical medication is more effective in proctitis and distal colitis, and the combination of topical and orally-administered drugs is superior to oral therapy alone also in extensive disease. Thus, this latter regimen should be considered for cases where the escalation of treatment is required. Systemic steroids still represent the first line therapy in acute, severe UC, while in patients who do not respond to steroids, cyclosporine and infliximab should be considered as a second line therapy and as alternatives for colectomy. Maintenance treatment is indicated in all UC cases. 5-ASA compounds are suggested as first line maintenance therapy with the optimal dose still being under investigation. Topical compounds are effective also for maintenance in distal colitis or proctitis, if accepted by the patients. Immunosuppressives, especially azathioprine, should be considered in chronically active, steroid dependent or resistant patients. According to recent publications, azathioprine is almost equally effective in UC and CD. The question of chemoprevention is important during maintenance. There are increasing data supporting the notion that aminosalicylates may lower the risk for UC-associated colorectal cancer. The most important changes in the management of UC are the more frequent use of topical aminosalicylates and azathioprine, the availability of infliximab in severe UC, and increasing use of aminosalicylates for chemoprevention of colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, adequate attention is needed to better organize the patient-doctor relationship and for greater adherence to medical therapy."}

Although second generation TKIs like dasatinib proved more efficient in achieving molecular remission compared to first generation TKI imatinib, it is unclear how individual responses differ between the drugs and whether mechanisms of drug action can be deduced from the dynamic data. We use time courses from the DASISION trial to address statistical differences in the dynamic response between first line imatinib vs. dasatinib treatment cohorts and we analyze differences between the cohorts by fitting an established mathematical\u00a0model of functional CML treatment to individual time courses. On average, dasatinib-treated patients show a steeper initial response, while the long-term response only marginally differed between the treatments. Supplementing each patient time course with a corresponding confidence region, we illustrate the consequences of the uncertainty estimate for the underlying mechanisms of CML remission. Our model suggests that the observed BCR-ABL dynamics may result from different, underlying stem cell dynamics. These results illustrate that the perception and description of CML treatment response as a dynamic process on the level of individual patients is a prerequisite for reliable patient-specific response predictions and treatment optimizations."}

A single conditioning clamp pulse with a duration from 10 ms to 1000 ms was applied from the resting potential (-82 mV) to 0 mV level using a suction pipette whole-cell voltage clamp technique, and the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) of a test action potential elicited 100 ms after termination of the clamp pulse was measured as an index of sodium channel availability. In myocytes treated with the eight drugs, such clamp pulse caused a significant decrease in Vmax. With mexiletine, tocainide, lidocaine, OPC-88117 and aprindine, the Vmax reduction was enhanced progressively as the clamp pulse duration was prolonged. With quinidine, disopyramide and AN-132, an appreciable Vmax reduction at the shortest clamp pulse was followed by an additional small enhancement of the Vmax decay. These findings suggest that the former group of drugs may block the sodium channel mainly during the inactivated state (inactivation blockers), whereas the latter one may do so mainly during the activated state (activation blockers). Multiple short clamp pulses caused a greater Vmax reduction than a single prolonged clamp pulse for the activation blockers, and vice-versa for the inactivation blockers. Molecular dimensions of the eight drugs, which were estimated by X-ray diffraction of crystals, did not satisfy a simple size criterion as proposed by Courtney (1988) to explain such different types of sodium channel block by Class-I drugs."}

Although many effective drugs are available, combinations of 2 or more medications are often required to meet clinical targets. Combination therapy has several advantages over monotherapy: lower doses of each drug can be used to achieve therapeutic goals; lower doses may lead to fewer adverse events, facilitating patient adherence; and using multiple drugs with different modes of action may be more effective in treating multifactorial diseases, including hypertension. Adherence is an important consideration when requiring patients to self-administer multiple medications; as the number of concurrent medications increases, patient adherence tends to decrease. Recent evidence suggests that fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) may be more effective than free-dose combinations, as they provide all necessary medications in a single convenient tablet/single-pill combination. Among combinations of hypertension medications, a \u03b2-blocker such as bisoprolol with a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine is an effective combination therapy for hypertension, with distinct and complimentary modes of action. With advantages over free-dose combinations, the FDC of bisoprolol/amlodipine is thus an effective and convenient treatment for hypertension, allowing more patients to achieve their therapeutic goals, while potentially reducing the burden of hypertension on health care systems."}

Suppression of neutrophil reactivity was accompanied by elevations in intracellular cAMP and accelerated clearance of Ca(2+) from the cytosol of activated neutrophils. These findings demonstrate that \u03b2 2-agonists vary with respect to their suppressive effects on activated neutrophils."}

This non-interventional, prospective study observed the effectiveness and tolerability of second-line treatment with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive relapse of ovarian cancer in routine clinical practice. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the survival and secondary endpoints were to evaluate time to disease progression, objective tumor response rate, and treatment toxicity. Patients were enrolled to planned second-line treatment with gemcitabine and carboplatin (gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 5 on Day 1, and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Day 8 of a 21-day cycle) for platinum-sensitive relapse of ovarian cancer as a part of routine clinical practice and followed for 12 months. The events (death, tumor progression), tumor response, and maximal grades of toxicity were recorded according to common clinical practice. Survival time (using Kaplan-Meier analysis) and objective tumor response rate were calculated using data forms, and a subgroup analysis was performed using log rank tests for time-to-event endpoints; p-values were also calculated. Response rates were calculated for the whole population; for the subgroups, the Fisher's exact test was performed and only p-values were calculated. Between January 2004 and June 2005, 53 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age was 57 years and 96% of patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) of 0 and 1 at baseline. Approximately 91% of patients were originally diagnosed with stage III or IV; 60% of patients had disease free intervals (DFIs) of 12 or more months from previous therapy, and the additional 40% less than 12 months. The 1-year survival rate was 83%. Median survival time was not determined within the 12-month period following the start of the treatment study due to the limited duration of follow-up.

The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) which plays a key role in controlling pituitary hormone secretion has been suggested to be a central target for adiponectin actions. A number of hormones produced by PVN neurons have been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis including oxytocin, corticotropin releasing hormone and thyrotropin releasing hormone. In the present study we investigated the role of adiponectin in controlling the excitability of magnocellular (MNC--oxytocin or vasopressin secreting) neurons within the PVN. Using RT-PCR techniques we have shown expression of both adiponectin receptors in the PVN. Patch clamp recordings from MNC neurons in hypothalamic slices have also identified mixed (27% hyperpolarization, 42% depolarization) effects of adiponectin in modulating the excitability of the majority of MNC neurons tested. These effects are maintained when cells are placed in synaptic isolation using tetrodotoxin. Additionally we combined electrophysiological recordings with single cell RT-PCR to examine the actions of adiponectin on MNC neurons which expressed oxytocin only, vasopressin only, or both oxytocin and vasopressin mRNA and assess the profile of receptor expression in these subgroups. Adiponectin was found to hyperpolarize 100% of oxytocin neurons tested (n = 6), while vasopressin cells, while all affected (n = 6), showed mixed responses. Further analysis indicates oxytocin neurons express both receptors (6/7) while vasopressin neurons express either both receptors (3/8) or one receptor (5/8). In contrast 6/6 oxytocin/vasopressin neurons were unaffected by adiponectin. Co-expressing oxytocin and vasopressin neurons express neither receptor (4/6). The results presented in this study suggest that adiponectin plays specific roles in controlling the excitability oxytocin secreting neurons, actions which correlate with the current literature showing increased oxytocin secretion in the obese population."}

Here, for the first time, Resveratrol (Res) was co-encapsulated with paclitaxel (PTX) in a PEGylated liposome to construct a carrier-delivered form of combination therapy for drug-resistant tumors. The composite liposome had an average diameter of 50 nm with encapsulated efficiencies of above 50%. The studies demonstrated that the composite liposome could generate potent cytotoxicity against the drug-resistant MCF-7/Adr tumor cells in vitro and enhance the bioavailability and the tumor-retention of the drugs in vivo.

BCL-2 proteins participate in the response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, their role in HCC therapy with sorafenib/regorafenib remains uncertain. BH3-mimetic ABT-263 (navitoclax) enhanced sorafenib activity, inducing cell death via a mitochondrial caspase-dependent mechanism, after BCL-xL/BCL-2 inhibition. Sorafenib-resistant hepatoma cells (HepG2R and Hep3BR) exhibited altered mRNA expression of BCL-2 and other anti-apoptotic family members, such as MCL-1, priming drug-resistant cancer cells to death by BH3-mimetics. ABT-263 restored sorafenib efficacy in sorafenib-resistant cell lines and HCC mouse models. Moreover, in mice xenografts from patient-derived BCLC9 cells, better tumor response to sorafenib was associated to higher changes in the BCL-2 mRNA pattern. HCC non-treated patients displayed altered BCL-2, MCL-1 and BCL-xL mRNA levels respect to adjacent non-tumoral biopsies and an increased BCL-2/MCL-1 ratio, predictive of navitoclax efficacy. Moreover, regorafenib administration also modified the BCL-2/MCL-1 ratio and navitoclax sensitized hepatoma cells to regorafenib by a mitochondrial caspase-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, sorafenib/regorafenib response is determined by BCL-2 proteins, while increased BCL-2/MCL-1 ratio in HCC sensitizes drug resistant-tumors against ABT-263 co-administration. Thus, changes in the BCL-2 profile, altered in HCC patients, could help to follow-up sorafenib efficacy, allowing patient selection for combined therapy with BH3-mimetics or early switch them to second line therapy."}

We found that the combination of vemurafenib and erlotinib was not synergistic to the inhibition of p-ERK signaling in BRAF-V600E cells. Vemurafenib caused significant apoptosis, G1 arrest and upregulation of BIM in BRAF-V600 cells. Trametinib was effective as a single agent in BRAF mutated cells, either V600E or non-V600E. Finally, the combination of vemurafenib and trametinib caused a small but significant increase in apoptosis as well as a significant upregulation of BIM when compared to either single agent. Thus, hinting at the possibility of utilizing a combinational approach for the management of this group of patients. Importantly, trametinib alone caused upregulation of p-AKT in BRAF non-V600 mutated cells, while this effect was nullified with the combination.

The heart/body weight ratios were dramatically reduced in captopril-treated SHRs to below the level of WKYs; hydralazine induced only a very modest (5%) reduction, whereas the diuretic alone was ineffective. The morphology of the aortic intima improved dramatically in response to captopril and hydralazine and, to a lesser extent, hydrochlorothiazide alone. This effect becomes apparent within 6 weeks of treatment, and the only evidence of preexisting disease is the persistence of collagen in the subendothelium. Captopril and hydralazine, but not hydrochlorothiazide alone, reduce the thickness of the aortic media below that of normotensive controls. In addition, captopril and hydralazine improve the structure of small intrarenal vessels. There was a strong correlation between the relative effectiveness of the three pharmacologic agents in lowering blood pressure and in improving the changes of intrarenal vessels. These results highlight the capacity of antihypertensive therapy to arrest or reverse the structural sequelae of hypertension. In addition, they underscore the heterogeneity in the response of different components of the cardiovascular system, which, in part, reflects selectivity in the action of antihypertensive agents."}

However, there is an improvement in disease-free survival of BCG-treated good- and average-risk girls (P = 0.04). While patients were actively receiving BCG there was also a trend toward the development of fewer significant infections than when patients were not receiving BCG (P = 0.85).

Following these high-dose conditioning regimens, a median number of 7.7 \u00d7 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg body weight (range: 2.9 \u00d7 10(6)-17.2 \u00d7 10(6)) were transplanted from 13 related or 17 unrelated donors. Antithymocyte globulin (Fresenius 30-60 mg/kg) as well as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. All patients except 1 with primary graft failure achieved complete remission after HSCT. After a median follow-up time of 28 months (range: 7-81), 21 patients (70%) were alive and free of disease. Overall, 4 patients relapsed. At 2 years, overall survival, event-free survival, and treatment-related mortality were 70%, 63%, and 30%, respectively. Because of undue toxicity, thiotepa is no longer part of the conditioning regimen. Our results add to the body of evidence that a FLAMSA-based sequential conditioning therapy is effective for previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS or sAML."}

Thioredoxin reductase 1 (Trr1) is an antioxidant and redox regulator that functions in governing the cellular redox state and survival against oxidative insults in mammals. However, this selenoprotein is also overexpressed in various forms of malignant cancers, leading to the hypothesis that Trr1 may be a potential target for cancer therapy. A quinone anti-cancer drug, mitomycin C (MMC), has been clinically used in the treatment of several types of tumors, including those of the colon. MMC exerts its activity via ROS induction and further results in DNA cross-linkage. To evaluate the significant role of Trr1 in MMC resistance in human colon cancer (RKO) cells, specific reduction in the expression of Trr1 was achieved using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based interference. Our results showed that stable Trr1 shRNA knockdown manifested higher cellular susceptibility to MMC in comparison to that in wild-type cells. In addition, increased intracellular ROS accumulation appeared in the Trr1 shRNA knockdown cells compared to the RKO wild-type cells, in proportion to a relatively higher fraction of the DNA damage reporter protein phosphorylated histone '\u03b3-H2AX'. Notably, a neutral comet assay demonstrated that DNA double-strand breaks were highly induced in the Trr1-deficient cancer cells in the presence of MMC, presumably stimulating cancer cell death. Our results also revealed that MMC-induced apoptosis was associated with enhancement of oxidative damage to DNA. These results suggest that the specific knockdown of Trr1 expression via shRNA vector interference technology may be a potent molecular strategy by which to enhance the effectiveness of MMC-mediated killing in human colon cancer cells, through acceleration of double-strand DNA damage-oxidative stress as a trigger for apoptosis. This implies that Trr1 may be a prime target for enhancing the effectiveness of MMC chemotherapy in combination with specific RNA interference."}

Using a double-blind approach, Qaw along with FEV(1) and Vmax(50) were determined before and after a 2-week treatment period with either ML (10 mg/day), FP (440 microg/day), or 10 mg of ML plus 440 microg of FP daily, separated by 2-week washout periods.

Six postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer, who responded to megestrol acetate after 6 weeks of treatment, were treated with the combination of megestrol acetate and tamoxifen during the next 6 weeks. The study was oriented towards the endocrine effects of this combination since it was known from our previous studies that megestrol acetate induces suppression of serum gonadotropins and of the pituitary-adrenal axis, a decrease of peripheral concentration of SHBG and of estradiol, and an increase of basal and TRH-stimulated plasma prolactin concentration. Tamoxifen, on the other hand, produces a decrease of prolactin and gonadotropins, whilst estradiol remains unaffected. Although the role of prolactin in the growth of human breast cancer has not been elucidated yet and there is no unequivocal evidence that a decrease in plasma prolactin could be of benefit for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, we tested whether addition of tamoxifen to the treatment regimen eliminated megestrol acetate-induced hyperprolactinaemia. The results show that addition of tamoxifen to megestrol acetate treatment annihilated the hyper-response of prolactin to TRH stimulation, while basal prolactin levels remained unaffected. The negative effect on plasma gonadotropin concentration appeared to be amplified, while estradiol and cortisol were not affected and SHBG increased.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive neurodegenerative disorder which affects medium spiny GABAergic neurons mainly in the striatum. Oxidative damage, neuro-inflammation, apoptosis, protein aggregation, and signaling of neurotrophic factors are some of the common cellular pathways involved in HD. Quinolinic acid (QA) causes excitotoxicity by stimulating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors via calcium overload leading to neurodegeneration. Neuroprotective potential of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonists and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been well documented in experimental models of neurodegenerative disorders; however, their exact mechanisms are not clear. Therefore, present study has been designed to explore possible neuroprotective mechanism of valproic acid (VPA) and its interaction with rosiglitazone against QA induced HD-like symptoms in rats. Single bilateral intrastriatal QA (200 nmol/2 \u03bcl saline) administration significantly caused motor incoordination, memory impairment, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction (complex I, II, II and IV), cellular alterations [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), caspase-3, brain derived neurotrophic factor, acetylcholinesterase], and striatal neurodegeneration as compared to sham group. Treatment with rosiglitazone (5, 10 mg/kg) and VPA (100, 200 mg/kg) for 21 days significantly attenuated these behavioral, biochemical, and cellular alterations as compared to control (QA 200 nmol) group. However, VPA (100 mg/kg) treatment in combination with rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg) for 21 days synergized their neuroprotective effect, which was significant as compared to their effects per se in QA-treated animals. The present study provides an evidence of possible interplay of PPAR\u03b3 agonists and HDAC inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy in the management of HD."}

In contrast to the undifferentiated stem cells, but as a number of myoblast and muscle cell lines, MES-1 cells respond to both carbachol and bradykinin by the rapid release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In addition, MES-1 express receptors for and respond mitogenically to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Isolated membranes from these cells retain the capacity to bind both ligands; addition of EGF to membranes induces endogenous phosphorylation of several proteins, including the EGF receptor itself and a 38 kD protein, while addition of PDGF specifically induces phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor. By contrast, other derivatives of P19, isolated from retinoic acid (RA)-treated aggregates and resembling neuroectodermal or endodermal cell types respond only to EGF; PDGF neither binds nor induces phosphorylation and a mitogenic response in these cells. During differentiation from EC cells therefore MES-1 cells developed a combination of growth factor receptor characteristics typical of somatic mesodermal cells and indicate that such receptors on EC-derived mesodermal cells are also functional."}

Somatostatin and neuropeptide Y concentrations have previously been reported to be increased in the basal ganglia in Huntington's disease (HD). In the present study we have extended these findings by examining both somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) and neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPYLI) in cases of HD, which were graded according to the severity of pathological degeneration in the striatum. In addition, we surveyed a large number of subcortical nuclei and cortical regions for alterations. Both SLI and NPYLI were significantly increased about threefold in the caudate, putamen, and the nucleus accumbens. Increases in mild and severe grades were similar, which is consistent with a relative but not absolute sparing of striatal aspiny neurons in which somatostatin and neuropeptide Y are colocalized. Significant increases of NPYLI were also found in the external pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra compacta, claustrum, anterior and dorsomedial thalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and locus ceruleus. SLI was significantly increased in the external pallidum, red nucleus, and locus ceruleus. Measurements of both neuropeptides were made in 24 regions of the cerebral cortex. Significant increases in both NPYLI and SLI were found in the frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 45) and temporal cortex (Brodmann area 21), whereas NPYLI was also increased in Brodmann areas 12, 20-22, 25, and 42. Alterations in the cerebral cortex were as pronounced in cases with mild striatal pathological changes as in those with severe striatal pathological changes. These alterations may occur early in HD and could reflect a selective sparing of somatostatin-neuropeptide Y cortical neurons combined with cortical atrophy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Considering polycation-free beads, barium-alginate induced the weakest reaction. Biocompatibility of microbeads was independent of mannuronic/guluronic acid ratio and molar mass of the alginate. Infiltration was mainly a monocyte/macrophage-rich foreign body reaction, but an eosinophil-containing immunoallergic reaction was also observed. Short-term immunosuppression significantly reduced infiltration in all conditions and up to 42 days after implantation. Biocompatibility after intraportal infusion was best for barium-alginate microbeads and poorest for polycation-containing microcapsules. Short- and long-term overgrowth could be significantly reduced by short-term immunosuppression."}

The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of anastrozole versus tamoxifen in this setting. A health economic model was developed comparing the natural history of EBC patients treated with anastrozole or tamoxifen. The perspective of the Belgian health care system was taken. Disease progression from EBC was obtained from the ATAC trial and further progression beyond the clinical trial from published literature. Resource use data were obtained from the ATAC study and from published local retrospective data. Anastrozole was cost-effective versus tamoxifen, provided that a time horizon of at least 9 years is taken. This sensitivity to time horizon is inherently associated with the adjuvant setting due to the different evolution of costs and outcomes over time. Costs are incurred solely during the first 5 years, whereas outcomes are cumulated beyond adjuvant treatment. In conclusion, provided that a sufficient time horizon is taken and that long-term model predictions are confirmed from further follow-up from the ATAC study, anastrozole is a highly cost-effective adjuvant therapy compared to tamoxifen."}

The best way to prevent rebleeding is early surgery. Even when surgery is performed within the first 72 hours posthaemorrhage, the risk of cerebral ischaemia due to vasospasm is high. Conventional medical treatment of cerebral vasospasm includes haemodilution, hypervolaemia and increase of arterial blood pressure. Haemodilution is of limited value as the patients suffering from SAH have usually a low haematocrit. The effectiveness of hypervolaemia is controversial and it may worsen cerebral and pulmonary oedema. Systemic hypertension is an effective therapy of vasospasm, but which can only be used once the aneurysm is controlled. Nimodipine and nicardipine, two calcium antagonists, have a beneficial effect on neurologic outcome following SAH. Today, it is still debated whether the beneficial effect of nimodipine results from the vascular effect of the drug or from a direct cerebral cytoprotective mechanism. Early surgery implies that surgeons operate on brains in acute inflammatory state. Thus, it is mandatory to use peroperative techniques improving cerebral exposure. These techniques include infusion of mannitol, lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, administration of anaesthetic agents known to decrease cerebral blood flow (CBF) and hypocapnia. Usually, the effect of CSF drainage is very effective and sufficient by itself. The second objective in the peroperative period is to avoid ischaemia. In areas with decreased flow distal to vasospasm, autoregulation is impaired and CBF is directly dependent on cerebral perfusion pressure. Furthermore, the safe practice of transient clipping of vessels supplying the aneurysm has dramatically reduced the indications of controlled hypotension. During temporary clipping, some authors recommend a pharmacological brain protection using barbiturates, etomidate or propofol, but this practice has not been validated by randomized studies. However, it is generally agreed that the arterial pressure should be increased during temporary clipping to improve collateral blood flow and to maintain it after the aneurysm has been secured. To conclude, together with lumbar CSF drainage and transient clipping, the anaesthetic management of the patients should include: maintenance of the arterial blood pressure close to its preoperative level, maintenance of PaCO2 between 30 and 35 mmHg and of normovolaemia through replacement of fluid and blood losses. After completion of surgery, recovery from anaesthesia should be rapid to allow fast diagnosis of neurological complications. The monitoring of the status of consciousness is the key of the diagnosis of early postoperative complications."}

Five malignant glioma cell lines were treated with IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, and/or anticancer agents (vincristine and etoposide). Combined treatment with IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma caused greater inhibition of TGF-beta secretion compared to treatment with IFN-gamma, and almost the same levels of inhibition as treatment with vincristine and etoposide. The greatest inhibition of TGF-beta secretion was achieved by treatment with all agents. Low levels of IL-10 secretion were determined in two out of five malignant glioma cell lines. This IL-10 secretion was inhibited by treatment with IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, vincristine, and/or etoposide. Treatment with both cytokines and anticancer agents increased the expression of MHC class I and ICAM-1 in all tumor cell lines. The mean increase of expression of MHC class I was 50% and that of ICAM-1 was 12-fold. No tumor cell lines expressed CD80 molecules on the cell surface, and no treatment caused CD80 expression. These results suggest that TGF-beta and IL-10 secretion by malignant glioma cells can be suppressed by treatment with a combination of IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, vincristine, and etoposide, and the treatment up-regulates MHC class I and ICAM-1 expression on tumor cells. These results have implications for immunotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with malignant tumors."}

Of 25 patients treated, 12% had a complete remission and 44% had a partial response. The median time to progression was 9 months (range, 1 to 20 months). In the next phase of development, a phase I trial evaluated sequentially administered paclitaxel and doxorubicin as initial therapy for metastatic disease. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor also was administered in each cycle. The dose-limiting toxicity was either stomatitis or neutropenic fever. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 125 mg/m2 for paclitaxel and 48 mg/m2 for doxorubicin. Because of much lower than anticipated MTDs of both drugs in this schedule, it was hypothesized that there may be a schedule-dependent toxicity; therefore, in the second phase I study the schedule of administration was reversed (ie, doxorubicin followed by paclitaxel infusion). The MTDs of this schedule were 60 mg/m2 and 150 mg/m2 for doxorubicin and paclitaxel, respectively. Pharmacokinetic studies subsequently have confirmed that administration of paclitaxel before doxorubicin impairs the elimination of doxorubicin by some unknown mechanism. In an ongoing phase II study, paclitaxel is being evaluated in patients who have received three or more treatments with chemotherapy. Paclitaxel is administered at doses of 135 and 150 mg/m2 (for poor- and good-risk patients, respectively) without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Six patients (19%) have shown objective partial responses. Our initial phase II study showed significant antitumor activity for paclitaxel in patients who had received limited prior chemotherapy. Our phase I studies established that initial administration of paclitaxel alters the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and increases morbidity. The reverse sequence of administration was associated with better tolerance and a higher MTD. In heavily treated patients this drug also has significant antitumor activity."}

Recent reports demonstrated that pomalidomide reduced or eliminated transfusion requirements in certain hematologic malignancies and induced HbF ex vivo in CD34(+) progenitor cells from healthy and SCD donors. We investigated the effects of pomalidomide on erythropoiesis and hemoglobin synthesis in a transgenic mouse model of SCD. We found that 8 weeks of treatment with pomalidomide induced modest increases of HbF with similar efficacy as hydroxyurea. However, in stark contrast to hydroxyurea's myelosuppressive effects, pomalidomide augmented erythropoiesis and preserved bone marrow function. Surprisingly, combinatory therapy with both drugs failed to mitigate hydroxyurea's myelotoxic effects and caused loss of HbF induction. These findings support further evaluation of pomalidomide as a novel therapy for SCD."}

However, in the majority of patients who develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), it is possible to detect persistent activation of the androgen receptor (AR) through androgens produced in the adrenal gland or within the tumor itself. Abiraterone acetate was developed as an irreversible inhibitor of the dual functional cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP17 with activity as a 17\u03b1-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase. CYP17 is necessary for production of nongonadal androgens from cholesterol. Regulatory approval of abiraterone in 2011, based on a phase III trial showing a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with abiraterone and prednisone versus prednisone, represented proof of principle that targeting AR is essential for improving outcomes in men with CRPC. Inhibition of 17\u03b1-hydroxylase by abiraterone results in accumulation of upstream mineralocorticoids due to loss of cortisol-mediated suppression of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), providing a rationale for development of CYP17 inhibitors with increased specificity for 17,20-lyase (orteronel, galeterone and VT-464) that can potentially be administered without exogenous corticosteroids.

Bioactivation probably occurs in the liver. Metabolism beyond activation to enalaprilat is not observed in man. Administration with food does not affect the bioavailability of enalapril; excretion of enalapril and enalaprilat is primarily renal. Peak serum enalaprilat concentrations are reached 4 hours post-dose, and the profile is polyphasic with a prolonged terminal half-life (greater than 30 hours) due to the binding of enalaprilat to ACE. Steady-state is achieved by the fourth daily dose, with no evidence of accumulation. The effective accumulation half-life following multiple dosing is 11 hours. Higher serum concentrations and delayed urinary excretion occur in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Enalapril reduces blood pressure in hypertensive patients by decreasing systemic vascular resistance. The blood pressure reduction is not accompanied by an increase in heart rate. Furthermore, cardiac output is slightly increased and cardiovascular reflexes are not impaired. Once- and twice-daily dosage regimens reduce blood pressure to a similar extent. Enalapril increases renal blood flow and decreases renal vascular resistance. Enalapril also augments the glomerular filtration rate in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 80 ml/min. Enalapril reduces left ventricular mass, and does not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise. There is no rebound hypertension after enalapril therapy is stopped. Enalapril does not produce hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia or hypercholesterolaemia. When combined with hydrochlorothiazide, enalapril attenuates the undesirable diuretic-induced metabolic changes. Therapeutic doses of enalapril do not affect serum prolactin and plasma cortisol in healthy volunteers or T3, rT3, T4 and TSH in hypertensive patients. Enalapril has natriuretic and uricosuric properties. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril is potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide, timolol and methyldopa, but unaffected by indomethacin and sulindac. No interactions occur between enalapril and frusemide, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin and warfarin. The bioavailability of enalapril is slightly reduced when propranolol is coadministered, but this does not appear to be of any clinical significance. Enalapril increases cardiac output and stroke volume and decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}

The heart rate and cardiac output (thermodilution) were reduced by metoprolol, even when combined with prazosin. Systolic ejection time was prolonged by metoprolol, but there were no changes in left ventricular dimensions at rest. During isometric handgrip the pressure increments were similar on each of the three regimens, although absolute diastolic pressure was lower on combined therapy. The arterial pressure increment on prazosin therapy was predominantly due to a rapid rise in heart rate and cardiac output, whereas with metoprolol and combined therapy the major contribution to the response was by peripheral vasoconstriction. Moreover, with the latter regimens there was a rapid rise in pulmonary artery occluded pressure, which did not occur with prazosin therapy. In conclusion, metoprolol alone, or combined with prazosin, caused significant depression of cardiac function, which was apparent only when the patients were subjected to the haemodynamic stress of isometric exercise."}

These results suggest that (i) ceftriaxone could increase hepatic blood flow and (ii) reduction of the hepatic clearance of ceftriaxone by diclofenac may be due to hepatic hemodynamic variations involving diclofenac inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, although an interaction of diclofenac with hepatic uptake of ceftriaxone cannot be ruled out."}

Although the role of prolactin in the growth of human breast cancer has not been elucidated yet and there is no unequivocal evidence that a decrease in plasma prolactin could be of benefit for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, we tested whether addition of tamoxifen to the treatment regimen eliminated megestrol acetate-induced hyperprolactinaemia. The results show that addition of tamoxifen to megestrol acetate treatment annihilated the hyper-response of prolactin to TRH stimulation, while basal prolactin levels remained unaffected. The negative effect on plasma gonadotropin concentration appeared to be amplified, while estradiol and cortisol were not affected and SHBG increased. The results of these endocrine investigations merit a further study, directed to antitumor effects of this combination modality."}

The times taken to reach Cmax and tmax, were 1.15 h and 1.06 h, respectively. The total areas under the curve (AUC(0-infinity)) were 312.61 ng.h/ml and 590.62 ng.h/ml, respectively. The half-life values (t1/2) were 5.52 h and 8.47 h. Statistically significant differences were observed for both AUC(0-infinity) and t1/2 of metoclopramide when administered alone or after 8 days treatment with fluoxetine. The experimental data demonstrate the pharmacokinetic interaction between fluoxetine and metoclopramide and suggest that the observed interaction may be clinically significant, but its relevance has to be confirmed."}

The difference was not statistically significant, but pretreatment characteristics predictive for response and survival were interesting. Three factors, leukemic change, poor performance status (PS), and T cell marker, were negatively associated with both CR and survival rates, and high-grade pathology was adversely associated with survival rate in a multivariate analysis. These prognostic factors are somewhat different from those in Western lymphomas. This may be reflection of major differences in patients' characteristics between Japanese and Western lymphomas: in this study, there was a high incidence of T cell lymphoma/leukemia (50%) including ATL (33%), leukemic manifestation (34%), poor PS (34%), and a low incidence of follicular lymphoma (9%). The statistically significant three factors for both CR and survival rates were used to construct a model containing eight categories of patients at increasing risk for poor response and shortened survival. These categories were divided into four groups, with respective CR and 4-year survival rates of 91% and 73%, 67% and 35%, 27% and 7%, and 10% and 5%. Ninety-three patients in whom CR was induced by VEPA or VEPA-M therapy were evaluated for prognostic factors predictive for disease-free survival. A shorter period (less than 28 days) required to achieve CR, a clinical diagnosis of ATL, and a lower hemoglobin level were found to affect disease-free survival adversely. These results have important implications for both the design of prospective randomized therapeutic trials and the determination of optimal therapy for individual patients."}

This trial was based upon in vitro studies which indicate that dipyridamole potentiates the cytotoxic action of methotrexate through inhibition of thymidine salvage. Methotrexate was given as a bolus injection 24 h after initiation of a high dose dipyridamole infusion. The trial was designed so that methotrexate was escalated in individuals until toxicity occurred and then the methotrexate dose resulting in toxicity was repeated without dipyridamole. During the course of this study the methotrexate dose was escalated from 10 to 130 mg/m2. While individual patient tolerance varied, moderate to severe myelosuppression and/or mucositis occurred frequently in patients receiving the combination with methotrexate doses greater than or equal to 60 mg/m2. Ten of 10 patients who experienced moderate or severe toxicity with the combination had significantly less toxicity when treated with methotrexate alone. Dipyridamole did not increase toxicity by an alteration in methotrexate elimination. The potentiation of methotrexate by dipyridamole in these patients suggests that physiological thymidine levels are sufficient to perturb the clinical effects of methotrexate and that thymidine salvage may represent a mechanism for clinical resistance to methotrexate. These results also suggest that a high dose dipyridamole regimen can be used as a pharmacological approach to test the role of nucleoside membrane flux on the clinical action of other standard chemotherapeutic drugs. Phase II studies testing the clinical efficacy of this combination should use a methotrexate dose of 60 mg/m2 with a provision for methotrexate dose escalation based upon individual patient tolerance."}

Subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to either topical dexamethasone (.5\u2009mg/mL) or tacrolimus (.5\u2009mg/mL) solution and instructed to rinse with 5\u2009mL for 5 minutes, 4 times a day, for 4 weeks. Oral cGVHD assessments (National Institutes of Health [NIH] criteria) were completed at baseline and end of treatment (NIH criteria, global response, and tolerability). The primary endpoint was the response rate defined as \u22653-point reduction in patient-reported sensitivity score (range, 0 to 10). A parallel 2-stage design was employed so that a less efficacious arm could be terminated early. The accrual goal was 60 evaluable patients; 30 in each arm), accruing 14 in the first stage and 16 in the second stage. If both arms were regarded as efficacious, a \"pick-the-winner\" method would be employed to choose a better treatment for future investigation. Forty-six subjects were randomized to receive either dexamethasone (n\u2009=\u200928) or tacrolimus (n\u2009=\u200918). Six subjects were excluded from the analysis because of changes in systemic immunosuppression (dexamethasone \u2009=\u20091, tacrolimus \u2009=\u20093) or lack of end-of-treatment visit (1 per arm). After the first stage evaluation, the tacrolimus arm was terminated because of lack of activity (3 of 14 responses; response rate, 21%). Twenty-six subjects in the dexamethasone arm completed both study visits and were included in the response analysis, with a 58% (15 of 26) response rate, compared with 21% (3 of 14) in the tacrolimus arm (P\u2009=\u2009.05). The response rates according to the NIH score in the dexamethasone and tacrolimus arms were 50% (13 of 26) and 2% (2 of 14), respectively (P\u2009=\u2009.04).

Dexamethasone rinses were well tolerated and taste was reported as \"very pleasant\" or \"tolerable\" in most subjects (96%). Intensive topical therapy with dexamethasone solution is effective for managing patients with new-onset symptomatic oral cGVHD and should be considered for first-line therapy. Topical tacrolimus solution appears less effective, at least for first-line therapy."}

While this model remains tractable, there are several limitations, presumably due to the constitutional Pkrdcscid (SCID, severe combined immune deficiency) mutation which affects DNA repair in all tissues of the mouse. These include the inability to combine preconditioning with subsequent chemotherapy, the inability to repeat chemotherapy cycles, and the increased sensitivity of the host hematopoietic cells to genotoxic stress. Here we attempt to address these drawbacks through the use of alternative strains with RAG-based immune deficiency (NRG and NRGS). We find that RAG-based mice tolerate a busulfan preconditioning regimen in combination with either AML or 4-drug acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) chemotherapy, expanding the number of samples that can be studied. RAG-based mice also tolerate multiple cycles of therapy, thereby allowing for more aggressive, realistic modeling. Furthermore, standard AML therapy in RAG mice was 3.8-fold more specific for AML cells, relative to SCID mice, demonstrating an improved therapeutic window for genotoxic agents. We conclude that RAG-based mice should be the new standard for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic strategies involving genotoxic agents."}

Scaffolds with different infill ratios of polylactic acid (PLA), both without drugs and impregnated with GS and MTX, were printed into cylindrical and rectangular-shaped constructs for compressive and flexural strength mechanical testing, respectively.

However, all responders develop resistance typically within 1 year of treatment with these inhibitors. Evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are elevated after BRAF pathway inhibition treatment. We aim to decipher the role of mitochondrial antioxidant proteins relative to ROS levels and BRAF pathway inhibitor resistance. We observed BRAF mutant melanoma cells treated with the combination of a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) and a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib), exhibited elevated ROS levels, both in in vitro and in vivo melanoma models. We next generated trametinib- and dabrafenib-resistant (TDR) cells and found increased ROS levels after acquisition of resistance. An immunofluorescence experiment showed an increase of DNA damage in TDR cell lines. Furthermore, we observed that TDR cells increased superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), an antioxidant, at both mRNA and protein levels, with the upregulation of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor (NF)-\u03baB. Knockdown of SOD2 significantly reduced the growth of BRAF pathway inhibitor-resistant cells. In addition, the results indicate that TDR cells can be re-sensitized to BRAF pathway inhibitors by the ROS scavenger, N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC). Overall, these data indicate that BRAF pathway inhibitor-resistant cells can compensate for elevated ROS via increased expression of the antioxidant SOD2."}

TGF-\u03b2 receptor activation and phosphorylation trigger a regulatory circuit of activating and inhibitory SMAD proteins and increased activation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway either by a loss of negative feedback or constitutive activation has been associated with the myelosuppression and ineffective erythropoiesis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Anemia is the predominant cause of morbidity and quality of life impairment in patients with lower-risk (LR)-MDS, and there are very limited therapy options for these patients after failure of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Targeting the aberrant TGF-\u00df signaling pathway has therefore been investigated as a promising therapeutic approach to resolve the ineffective erythropoiesis in LR-MDS. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascade in hematopoiesis under physiologic conditions and its role in MDS pathogenesis. We also review preclinical and clinical data for the activin receptor type IIA ligand traps sotatercept and luspatercept that have recently shown promising results in overcoming the myelosuppressive effects of TGF-\u03b2 signaling alterations to improve hematopoiesis in transfusion-dependent, non-del(5q) LR-MDS patients. Additional potential targets within the TGF-\u03b2 pathway have also been identified in preclinical experiments and may provide further therapeutic options. Finally, combining different TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitors or using them in combination with ESAs or the immunomodulator lenalidomide might have synergistic effects as well."}

The effects of the coadministration of pravastatin and an angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker, olmesartan, on glucose intolerance were examined using type II diabetic mice. Male KK-A(y) mice (8 weeks of age) were treated with pravastatin and/or olmesartan for 2 weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed with an administration of 2 g kg(-1) glucose. Tissue glucose uptake was determined using 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose. The treatment of mice with pravastatin attenuated the increase in the plasma glucose level during OGTT in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the plasma insulin level. Pravastatin increased glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissue such as the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue after treatment at 5-20 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 2 weeks, but not at 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1). The combination of a noneffective dose of pravastatin (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and a noneffective dose of olmesartan (0.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) synergistically improved OGTT without affecting the plasma insulin level. This combination also increased 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose uptake in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The effects of pravastatin or olmesartan on OGTT and tissue 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose uptake were significantly enhanced by an antioxidant, tempol, whereas the effects of a pravastatin-olmesartan combination were not further enhanced by tempol. These results indicate that the combination of pravastatin and olmesartan synergistically improves glucose intolerance through an increase in tissue glucose uptake. The effects seem to be mediated by an increase in insulin sensitivity through the inhibition of oxidative stress."}

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the 12 chemotherapy regimens for advanced NSCLC were included. Direct and indirect evidence were combined by NMA to evaluate the odds ratio and the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) of the 12 chemotherapy regimens. Nineteen RCTs that met our inclusion criteria were collected in this study. For partial response (PR), gemcitabine exhibited relatively poor efficacy compared with cisplatin\u00a0+\u00a0gemcitabine, carboplatin\u00a0+\u00a0gemcitabine, carboplatin\u00a0+\u00a0paclitaxel, paclitaxel\u00a0+\u00a0gemcitabine, and cisplatin\u00a0+\u00a0gemcitabine\u00a0+\u00a0vinorelbine.

They act by binding to tubulin, producing unnaturally stable microtubules and subsequent cell death. The distribution and elimination of paclitaxel depend on dose and administration rate. This nonlinearity is much less evident at lower infusion rates (24-hour infusions) and more evident at high plasma concentrations (3-hour infusions). The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel also suggest the presence of nonlinear pathways, but these appear to be clinically insignificant at the current doses utilised (60 to 100 mg/m2). Both agents undergo hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and require dose adjustment in the setting of liver dysfunction. Drug interactions are quite common with these agents, some of which are sequence-dependent and clinically significant. The optimal dose of paclitaxel is not known at this time, and controversy over possible dose- or schedule-related differences in efficacy still remain. Docetaxel is somewhat more consistent in its dose and scheduling information, but controversy remains regarding a dose-benefit relationship as well as scheduling differences (weekly vs every 3 weeks). Toxicity profiles for these agents are somewhat different. Paclitaxel is more likely to be associated with peripheral neuropathy and myalgias/arthralgias than docetaxel. Docetaxel is more likely to be associated with a cumulative fluid retention syndrome that can be dose limiting. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are both highly active agents against breast cancer, including tumours that are resistant to anthracyclines. Docetaxel tends to have higher response rates overall, but direct comparisons at maximally tolerated doses have not been completed. Combination regimens with many different agents are attempting to improve on the responses seen with single-agent taxanes. The combination of paclitaxel and a platinum compound should be utilised as first-line therapy of advanced ovarian cancer. Controversy lies in the choice of the platinum compound and the dose and administration schedule of paclitaxel. Substitution of docetaxel for paclitaxel in these platinum-containing regimens is also being investigated. The taxanes also exhibit activity against ovarian cancer in patients previously exposed to platinum agents. These agents may also be administered intraperitoneally for local therapy of metastatic ovarian cancer. Although docetaxel and paclitaxel are often considered similar in activity and tolerability, this review emphasises the fact that these agents are indeed different. Clinicians need to be familiar with the benefits and adverse events related to each agent in order to make informed, appropriate clinical decisions."}

There is also evidence that presumed pre-diabetic conditions such as insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and compensatory hyperglycaemia may amplify overall cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, especially when encountered as part of the condition known as metabolic syndrome X (Reaven's syndrome). The long-term benefits of antihypertensive therapy may be compromised if these drugs exert adverse effects on metabolic parameters such as insulin sensitivity, or if they promote a transition from pre-diabetes to overt diabetes. Class differences in the effects of antihypertensives on metabolic indices may therefore be an important consideration when choosing treatment for patients who exhibit these characteristics. Experience from clinical trials suggests that drugs that target the renin-angiotensin system may have metabolic advantages over drugs such as beta-blockers and diuretics, but this conclusion has not been proved definitively. Moxonidine, which selectively targets imidazoline type-1 receptors in the sympathetic vasomotor centres of the rostral-ventrolateral medulla, is an effective antihypertensive and has been reported to exert favourable metabolic effects in preclinical and clinical studies. The MARRIAGE study (Moxonidine And Ramipril Regarding Insulin And Glucose Evaluation) will extend these preliminary observations by comparing the effects of moxonidine and the ACE inhibitor ramipril--and the combination of both drugs--on metabolic and haemodynamic parameters in patients with hypertension and impaired fasting glycaemia.

Lymphoma cell lines U937 and J45.01, and patient-derived cell samples were exposed to these drugs and the effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis were quantified. The combination BMGPV was found to exert strong synergistic cytotoxicity. Drug exposure to these cells activated the ATM pathway and modified histones at the epigenetic level. Cell death was triggered by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane, upregulation of proapoptotic factors, and activation of caspases. Downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins c-MYC, MCL-1, and BCL-2 and inhibition of the prosurvival PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, culminated in apoptosis.

A partially synchronized S-wave occurs 4-8 and 16-20 hours following a two-hour drug exposure. Bleomycin produces a dose dependent G2/M block during a 14-hour drug exposure.

In vitro exposure to the two drug combination resulted in loss of both the marked G2/M accumulation seen with bleomycin, and the partially synchronized S-phase waves seen following mitomycin C exposure. The sequential changes in bone marrow cytokinetics were determined in eight patients during and following administration of vincristine, mitomycin C and a continuous four-day infusion of bleomycin. The major cytokinetic changes observed were an increase in G2/M phase cells 18 hours following vincristine, and an increase in thymidine incorporation and S-phase cells 24 and 48 hours following the end of the bleomycin infusion. The clinical course of 24 patients was reviewed. Eleven patients who received methotrexate 36 to 42 hours following bleomycin had a subsequent median leukocyte nadir of 1.8 x 10(3)/mm3.

This article reviews randomized clinical trials assessing second-line treatment after failure of first-line single-agent 5-FU, irinotecan-based treatment, or oxaliplatin-based treatment. A number of conclusions can be drawn based on available data. (1) Second-line chemotherapy with active agents is superior to best supportive care alone. (2) Following 5-FU failure, active regimens include irinotecan, FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, and IROX, with IROX appearing to be superior to FOLFIRI. (3) Following irinotecanbased first-line treatment, FOLFOX is in general the best choice, and the combination of FOLFOX plus bevacizumab appears to be superior to FOLFOX alone. (4) Following first-line FOLFOX, irinotecan and FOLFIRI are currently the most appropriate options. Irinotecan plus cetuximab should emerge as an effective regimen. Further study is needed to define the best options in second-line therapy following the FOLFOXIRI triplet or the combination of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy. Studies are ongoing to determine optimal use of biologic agents, both in terms of when they should be used and in what combinations."}

However, outgrowth of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) can occur due to the expression of constitutively active (ligand-independent) AR splice variants, particularly AR-V7. We previously demonstrated that sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate phytochemical, can decrease AR-FL levels in the PCa cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2B. Here, we examined the efficacy of SFN in targeting both AR-FL and AR-V7 in the CRPC cell line, CWR22Rv1 (22Rv1). MTT cell viability, wound-heal assay, and colony forming unit (CFU) measurements revealed that 22Rv1 cells are resistant to the anti-androgen, enzalutamide (ENZ). However, co-exposure to SFN sensitized these cells to the potent anticancer effects of ENZ (P<0.05). Immunoblot analyses showed that SFN (5-20\u00a0\u00b5M) rapidly decreases both AR-FL and AR-V7 levels, and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) depicted decreased AR in both cytoplasm and nucleus with SFN treatment. SFN increased both ubiquitination and proteasomal activity in 22Rv1 cells. Studies using a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) or a proteasomal inhibitor (MG132) indicated that SFN increases both ubiquitin-mediated aggregation and subsequent proteasomal-degradation of AR proteins. Previous studies reported that SFN inhibits the chaperone activity of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and induces the nuclear factor erythroid-2-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor. Therefore, we investigated whether the Hsp90 inhibitor, ganetespib (G) or the Nrf2 activator, bardoxolone methyl (BM) can similarly suppress AR levels in 22Rv1 cells. Low doses of G and BM, alone or in combination, decreased both AR-FL and AR-V7 levels, and combined exposure to G+BM sensitized 22Rv1 cells to ENZ. Therefore, adjunct treatment with the phytochemical SFN or a safe pharmaceutical combination of G+BM may be effective against CRPC cells, especially those expressing AR-V7."}

These include antimesothelin immunotoxins (SS1P, RG7787/LMB-100), chimeric antimesothelin antibody (amatuximab), mesothelin-directed antibody drug conjugates (anetumab ravtansine, DMOT4039A, BMS-986148), live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes-expressing mesothelin (CRS-207, JNJ-64041757), and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies. Two antimesothelin agents are currently in multicenter clinical registration trials for malignant mesothelioma: amatuximab in the first-line setting and anetumab ravtansine as second-line therapy. Phase II randomized clinical trials of CRS-207 as a boosting agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition for pancreatic cancer are nearing completion. These ongoing studies will define the utility of mesothelin immunotherapy for treating cancer."}

We report here that the PI3K/AKT pathway is constitutively active in BRCA1-defective human breast cancer cells. Levels of phospho-AKT are sustained even after serum starvation in breast cancer cells carrying deleterious BRCA1 mutations. Knockdown of BRCA1 in MCF7 cells increases the amount of phospho-AKT and sensitizes cells to small molecule protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway. Restoration of wild type BRCA1 inhibits the activated PI3K/AKT pathway and de-sensitizes cells to PKIs targeting this pathway in BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells, regardless of PTEN mutations. In addition, clinical PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, PI-103, and BEZ235, showed anti-proliferative effects on BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cell lines and synergism in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, cisplatin, doxorubicin, topotecan, and gemcitabine. BEZ235 synergizes with the anti-proliferative effects of gemcitabine by enhancing caspase-3/7 activity. Our results suggest that the PI3K/AKT pathway can be an important signaling pathway for the survival of BRCA1-defective breast cancer cells and pharmacological inhibition of this pathway is a plausible treatment for a subset of breast cancers."}

Tumor microenvironment-targeting drugs, such as VEGF(R) and PDGFR inhibitors, can lower the heightened interstitial fluid pressure in tumors, a barrier to drug delivery. Here, we investigated whether tumor microenvironment-targeting drugs enhance the effectiveness of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. A mouse xenograft model with two large peritoneal implants of colorectal cancer cells was developed to study drug distribution and tumor physiology during intraperitoneal Oxaliplatin perfusion. Mice were treated for six days with either Placebo, Imatinib (anti-PDGFR, daily), Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF, twice) or Pazopanib (anti-PDGFR, -VEGFR; daily) followed by intraperitoneal oxaliplatin chemotherapy.

A cream containing 5% aciclovir and 1% hydrocortisone has been authorised in France for symptomatic treatment of herpes labialis in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older. In a double-blind randomised trial comparing the combination versus topical aciclovir alone in 1443 adults, the cream did not significantly reduce the number of patients whose lesions became ulcerated, or the duration of the episode. In another comparative double-blind randomised trial in 107 immunocompromised patients, the efficacy of the aciclovir and hydrocortisone combination did not differ from that of aciclovir alone. Whatever the mode of administration, corticosteroids might aggravate infections. In clinical trials involving immunocompetent adults or adolescents, most adverse effects associated with the hydrocortisone + aciclovir combination were local and mild.

Using the in vivo microdialysis method, we investigated the effects of systemic injections of varenicline on the extracellular accumbal dopamine levels in response to a systemic challenge of ethanol, nicotine, or the combination of nicotine and ethanol in the experimental rat. Acute systemic coadministration of varenicline and ethanol counteracted each others' respective enhancing effect on dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. However, after 5 days of varenicline pretreatment, acute combined varenicline and ethanol administration raised dopamine levels to the same extent as either drug alone. Furthermore, after varenicline pretreatment an acute injection of varenicline antagonized the dopamine stimulatory effect of acute nicotine as well as that of systemic coadministration of ethanol and nicotine. In contrast, a pronounced additive dopamine increase was observed when nicotine and ethanol were coadministered in vehicle-pretreated rats. The antismoking agent varenicline exhibits properties with respect to its interaction with ethanol and nicotine in the brain reward system that may be beneficial for treating patients with alcohol dependence with (and possibly also without) concomitant nicotine dependence."}

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RNA was extracted from archived tumor samples derived from 378 patients with stage I to III HR-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR for a panel of 374 genes, including the 21-gene recurrence score (RS). Patients were randomized to receive adjuvant doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide or docetaxel in trial E2197, with no difference in recurrence seen in the treatment arms. All available recurrent cases were selected plus a nonrecurrent cohort. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify relationships between gene expression and recurrence. RESULTS: TOP2A expression exhibited the strongest association with increased recurrence risk (P = 0.01), and was significantly associated with recurrence (P = 0.008) in a multivariate analysis adjusted for clinicopathologic features. Elevated TOP2A expression above the median was associated with a 2.6-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.2; P = 0.008) in risk of recurrence if the RS was <18, and a 2.0-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2, P = 0.003) if there was an intermediate RS of 18 to 30. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HR-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer, a population known to have a low incidence of TOP2A gene alterations thought to be predictive of anthracycline benefit, there is a range of TOP2A RNA expression that is strongly associated with recurrence after adjuvant anthracyclines, which provides information complementary to RS, indicating that it merits further evaluation as a prognostic and predictive marker.

The AHR agonist activities of the pharmaceuticals depended on structure, response, and cell context. Most compounds induced one or more AHR-mediated responses in BT474 cells, whereas in Ah-responsive MDA-MB-468 cells effects of the AHR-active pharmaceuticals were highly variable. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen, mexiletine, and tranilast did not induce CYP1A1 in MDA-MB-468 cells; moreover, in combination with TCDD, mexiletine was a potent AHR antagonist, tranilast was a partial antagonist, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen also exhibited some AHR antagonist activity. Omeprazole and, to a lesser extent, sulindac and leflunomide were full and partial AHR agonists, respectively, in both breast cancer cell lines.

Bone scans were performed before and 3 or 4 months after therapy. After CAF therapy, markers were measured monthly. As a control, the markers of nine patients without bone metastases who received adjuvant CAF therapy were also measured monthly. The therapeutic effect on bone metastases was assessed after the study. Five patients had progression of disease (PD), three had no change (NC), and 15 patients had partial responses (PR). Bone scan flare-up was seen in five PR patients. In patients who received adjuvant therapy, ICTP, BAI-p, and CA15-3 did not change. ICTP increased significantly in PD patients. ICTP did not increase in either NC or PR, including bone scan flare patients. BAI-p and CA15-3 did not show any discernible pattern among PD, PR, flare, and NC patients.

These results suggest that the higher potency of selective PDE type IV & V inhibitors compared with PDE type III inhibitors vs. ovalbumin-induced contraction is due to their greater inhibition of anaphylactic mediator release. The converse is true if we consider their bronchodilator actions, although the superior efficacy of selective PDE type III inhibitors over PDE type IV inhibitors may vary in sensitized vs. non-sensitized animals. The present results are in agreement with a previous study showing that low concentrations of a beta 2-agonist increased the relaxant effect of selective PDE type IV inhibitors in guinea-pig trachea. The present data indicate that prophylactic use of selective PDE type IV inhibitors combined with therapeutic use of low dose inhaled beta-agonist might represent an alternative to the use of antiallergic or steroid therapy in asthma."}

It occurs in almost 42% of men and in 75% of women with schizophrenia who are treated with prolactin-raising antipshycotics, even though it has aroused minimal interest within the scientific community when compared with extra-pyramidal effects. Conventional antipsychotics and some of the atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, paliperidone, amisulpride and zotepine, are frequently associated with the raise in prolactin plasma levels. Because of this increment in prolactin secretion, they are usually known as prolactin-raising antipshycotics. On the contrary, some of the atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole and ziprazidone, have a minimal or no significant effect in prolactin levels, being known as prolactin-sparing antipsychotics. Hyperprolactinemia clinical symptoms include gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularities, infertility, sexual dysfunction, acne and hirsutism. Some of these symptoms are due to the prolactin direct action in body tissues, while a couple of them can be due to a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysregulation mediated by the elevation of prolactin. Some studies seem to point the evidence of an association between hyperprolactinemia and long-term consequences, such as bone mineral density decrement and breast cancer. However, these results must be confirmed through further studies. Antipsychotic treatment is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia in psychiatric patients. However, the evidence of a prolactin increased plasma level demands the differential diagnosis with other pathologies, such as hyphotalamic and pituitary neoplasic disease. The management of a patient with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia must be adapted to each patient and it may include a reduction in the dosage of the offending antipsychotic, switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic or the use of a dopamine receptor agonist, such as bromocriptine, cabergoline and amantadine. Given the osteopenic and osteoporosis risk, combined oral contraceptives must be considered in female patients in fertile age which have amenorrhoea for at least a one year period. With the exception of the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, none of the current international psychiatric guidelines recommend a routine baseline prolactin determination, neither periodic prolactin levels without the presence of any hyperprolactinemia symptoms."}

Forty-six patients with advanced gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. The treatment consisted of doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 given intravenously on days 1 and 7, etoposide 70 mg/m2 intravenously on days 4, 5, and 6, and carboplatin 200 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2 and 8. Therapy was repeated every 4 weeks. Patients who had stable disease or who responded, received an additional two to six cycles of therapy. Among 45 patients evaluable for response and toxicity, there was a 49% objective response rate, including 7% complete remission and 42% partial response. There was 11% stable disease and 27% progressive disease. Among 11 patients with lymph node metastasis only after a curative gastrectomy, there was an 82% objective response rates with 27% having complete remission and 55% having partial response. The median follow-up was 16 months. The median survival duration of all 45 patients was 11 months. The median time to progression was 5 months. The main toxicity was myelosuppression, with a high incidence of 82% leukopenia but only 9% of grades III to IV. Gastrointestinal toxicity was mild, with a low incidence of 42% nausea and vomiting and only 2% of grades III to IV. There were no chemotherapy-related deaths. With mild and tolerable toxicity, the EAC regimen in our study has active antitumor activity in advanced gastric cancer, which may have a positive influence on long-term survival time. It has a high efficacy, especially in patients with lymph node metastasis only after a curative gastrectomy. This regimen deserves further clinical studies for testing activity and toxicity in advanced gastric cancer."}

Cardiac glycosides (CGs) belong to NKA inhibitors and possess potent anti-cancer properties in many cancers. Our previous work demonstrates that CGs family member digoxin or ouabain induces autophagic cell death in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines through regulation of both mammalian target of rapamycin and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. However, what acts as an upstream regulator of ERK1/2 activation during autophagy induction remains obscure. In the present study, the role of Src in the ERK1/2 signaling pathway as well as autophagic cell death induced by either digoxin or ouabain was examined in A549 and H460 cells. Src is significantly activated simultaneously with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2 activation upon the drug treatment. Moreover, Src inhibitor PP2 could block either drug induced MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, together with autophagic phenotypes in the cells. Knockdown of Src with siRNA causes the similar effect as PP2, both of which markedly alleviate the drugs' cytotoxicity. In addition, increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are found to be involved in Src mediated autophagy. Together, this work provides evidences showing that Src mediates MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 pathway as well as ROS generation, and regulates autophagic cell death induced by the cardiac glycosides. These observations may further help understand the molecular mechanisms of autophagy induced by NKA inhibitors in NSCLC cells."}

Antimalarials are rarely valuable as sole agents in progressive arthritis. The use of sulphasalazine, gold thiomalate, d-penicillamine, auranofin, methotrexate, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide in rheumatoid arthritis and their place in the therapeutic strategy are discussed. The reported use of combination chemotherapy has not shown the expected additive benefits although azathioprine, methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine combination may prove to be better than single agents.

Cryptophycin 52 that is currently in clinical trial in solid tumors, is prepared by total synthesis of four key fragments that are coupled to form the final product. The mechanism of anticancer activity of the cryptophycins has been associated with their destabilization of microtubules and with their induction of bcl-2 phosphorylation leading to apoptosis. The cryptophycins maintain activity against ovarian and breast carcinoma cells that overexpress the multidrug resistance efflux pump P-glycoprotein. Cryptophycin 52 has demonstrated a broad range of antitumor activity against both murine and human tumors. In the human MX-1 breast carcinoma xenograft cryptophycin 55 produced greater-than- additive tumor response in combination with 5-fluorouracil. In human non-small cell lung carcinoma and human small cell carcinoma xenografts, administration of the cryptophycins along with gemcitabine, cisplatin or carboplatin resulted in antitumor activity greater than either agent alone. The cryptophycins appear to be additive with fractionated radiation therapy in the human H460 non-small cell lung carcinoma. In the human HCT116 colon carcinoma, the cryptophycins resulted in a greater than additive tumor response when administered sequentially with 5-fluorouracil or irinotecan.

The molecular characterization of this early host:pathogen interface may identify novel targets for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention. Genetic analyses in mouse model of malaria show that inactivation of the enzyme pantetheinase (Char9 locus) causes susceptibility to blood-stage infection. The pantetheinase product cysteamine is an inexpensive and non-toxic aminothiol that is approved for lifelong clinical management of nephropathic cystinosis. In mouse models of infection, cysteamine not only displays anti-malarial activity of its own, but also dramatically potentiates the anti-malarial activity of artemisinin, at doses currently used for the clinical management of cystinosis.

This was done to take advantage of the cellular and molecular synergism between paclitaxel and DNA-damaging agents, with the hope of avoiding paclitaxel-cisplatin toxicities. Paclitaxel was given as a 24-hr CIVI, after which cyclophosphamide was given as a 60-min infusion. Cycles of therapy were repeated every 3 weeks; and granulocyte colony-simulating factor (G-CSF) was given in a \"flexible\" dosing fashion. Starting doses were 170 mg/m2 paclitaxel and 750 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was seen at the doses of 250 mg/m2 paclitaxel and 1250 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide. DLT was cumulative thrombocytopenia. There were six nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 toxicities experienced in the study. Eleven of 20 evaluable patients (55%) have achieved an objective response (4 CCR;7 PR). Three of four CCRs were confirmed by negative findings at peritoneoscopy. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range 1-4) and 17 individuals had platinum-refractory disease. We conclude that paclitaxel followed by cyclophosphamide is an active combination in recurrent ovarian cancer and that further study is needed to determine if this combination is truly better than paclitaxel alone."}

The mechanism of action of these drugs was studied. A 25-micrograms dose of testosterone propionate at 5 days of age produced a 69% incidence of persistent estrus at 90 days of age. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine given with testosterone propionate resulted in an 81% incidence of persistent estrus. Therefore, hypothalamic norepinephrine depletion did not prevent androgenization. Tyramine (100 micrograms) inhibited androgenization to an incidence of 27% by 90 days. Phenoxybenzamine (50 micrograms) and phentolamine (50 micrograms) each reduced the incidence to 0%. Combining the beta-antagonist propranolol with phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine reversed the block in androgenization, resulting in 37% and 50% incidences of persistent estrus, respectively. Tyramine causes the release of neuronal stores of norepinephrine which is turn stimulates alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The action of tyramine implicates adrenergic stimulation as a mechanism for the inhibition of androgenization, but does not define which receptor type is involved. In addition to postsynaptic alpha-blockade, phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine can cause presynaptic alpha-blockade, resulting in increased neuronal norepinephrine release and beta-stimulation. When the beta-antagonist propranolol was added to the alpha-antagonists, the block in androgenization was reversed. Therefore, we conclude that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation prevents androgenization of the neonatal rat brain."}

The patients sometimes benefit from high doses of oral corticosteroids. However, pulse therapy with high doses of prednisolone (or dexamethasone) in combination with other immunosuppressants induces variable and inconstant results. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been applied in different cases of PNP with encouraging results. Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange (PE) in combination with corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide or azathioprine showed similar rapid and beneficial results in association with decreasing auto-antibody levels in this group of refractory pemphigus. Another interesting therapeutic option is rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen, which is found on the surface of normal and malignant B-lymphocytes. Administration of rituximab for patients with PNP in combination with follicular NHL is not always successful regarding oral lesions as we report in this case. PE leading to prompt depletion of autoreactive antibodies combined with immunosuppressants or synchronisation of PE with IVIg seems the best treatment modality for this refractory group, but the therapeutic value and appropriate timing of rituximab obviously deserve further evaluation in patients with low grade NHL and PNP."}

The delayed depolarization is the subject of the present study. The delayed depolarization could be elicited by long (> 1 s) ACh pressure pulses or by short pulses (10 ms) of carbachol, nicotine and DMPP, but not by muscarinic agonists. It was inhibited by bath application of nicotine (10-100 mumol l-1), strychnine (100 mumol l-1) and atropine (10-100 mumol l-1). Nicotinic antagonists that blocked the fast depolarization and the slow hyperpolarization (100 mumol l-1 mecamylamine and d-tubocurarine) did not affect the delayed depolarization induced by carbachol. Partial replacement of the extracellular Na+ by glucamine caused a decrease in the amplitude of the response and a shift of its reversal potential to more negative values. Carbachol pulses applied to Retzius neurons of the ganglia innervating the reproductive segments elicited delayed depolarizations of much smaller amplitude than the ones recorded in Retzius neurons from standard segments. The delayed depolarization could be elicited by the application of short agonist pulses onto different loci over the surface of the ganglion, at a distance from the soma. Isolated cultured Retzius neurons did not exhibit the delayed depolarization although they readily expressed the earlier phases of the complex cholinergic response. Carbachol pulses applied to the soma of other neurons in the leech ganglion produced a variety of specific responses. The results suggest that the delayed depolarization was produced by the activation of a cationic conductance mediated by receptors with a pharmacological profile similar to that of the alpha 9 nicotinic receptors and was not a byproduct of the early phases of the cholinergic response. The response seemed to be initiated in the extensive neuropilar processes of the Retzius cell, enabling a persistent excitatory signal."}

In immature rats, all four of the antiestrogens inhibited estrogen action in diaphysis, epiphysis, uterus and mesometrial adipose tissue; when administered alone, tamoxifen stimulated creatine kinase (CK) specific activity in all these tissues. Raloxifene and TMI, however, stimulated only the skeletal tissues and had no stimulatory effect in the uterus or mesometrial fat, and the pure antiestrogen ICI 164,384 showed no stimulatory effect in any of the tissues. The simultaneous injection of estrogen, plus an antiestrogen which acted as an agonist, resulted in lower CK activity than after injection of either agent alone. These differential effects, in vivo and in vitro, may point the way to a wider therapeutic choice of an appropriate antiestrogen which, although antagonizing E2 action in mammary cancer, can still protect against osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease and not stimulate the uterus with its attendant undesirable changes, or interfere with the beneficial action of E2 in the brain."}

The contractions of the isolated rat diaphragm elicited by either indirect or direct electrical stimulation were inhibited by propofol emulsion at threshold concentrations of 42 and 112 mumol l-1, respectively. Similarly, the gastrocnemius muscle contractions induced by either indirect or direct electrical stimulation in vivo were inhibited by propofol emulsion administration as a bolus injection of 2.5 mg kg-1 intravenously, followed by intravenous infusion of 150 micrograms kg-1 min-1 for 1 h into rats. The inhibitory effects of propofol in both preparations were greater with indirect rather than direct stimulation. Propofol emulsion was found to be capable of enhancing the paralysis of the indirectly stimulated rat diaphragm in vitro and gastrocnemius muscle in vivo induced by either pipecuronium or succinylcholine. The combination of propofol and pipecuronium led to a synergistic inhibition of the neuromuscular transmission, while the combination of propofol and succinylcholine led to additive inhibition. Pretreatment with propofol emulsion at these threshold concentrations markedly inhibited the stimulant effects of aminophylline and digoxin on the indirectly and directly induced diaphragmatic contractions. Also, the enhancement effects of aminophylline on the indirectly and directly and of digoxin on indirectly induced rat gastrocnemius muscle contractions were markedly inhibited by propofol emulsion administration to rats. Pretreatment with propofol emulsion at the threshold concentrations enhanced the inhibitory effects of verapamil on diaphragmatic contractions elicited either indirectly or directly and enhanced the inhibitory effect of adenosine on the contractions elicited indirectly. Similarly, the inhibitory effects of verapamil on the indirectly and directly and of adenosine on indirectly induced rat gastrocnemius muscle contractions were markedly potentiated by propofol emulsion administration to rats. In addition, doubling the concentration of calcium in the bathing fluid produced no change in the inhibitory effects of propofol emulsion on either indirectly or directly elicited diaphragmatic contractions, while doubling the concentration of external magnesium potentiated the propofol effects. Pretreatment with 4-aminopyridine suppressed the inhibitory effects of propofol emulsion on diaphragmatic contractions elicited either indirectly or directly. These results suggest that propofol acts presynaptically to inhibit the neuromuscular transmission and acts at the muscle membrane to inhibit the muscular contraction."}

Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues offer a different approach to the management of early breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal women. The most widely studied LHRH analogue is goserelin. It acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to suppress ovarian function, decreasing luteinizing hormone and oestradiol levels to post-menopausal values. Pooled data from 228 premenopausal and perimenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer enrolled in 29 studies worldwide demonstrated an objective response rate for goserelin, 3.6 mg, of 36.4%, with a median duration of response of 44 weeks. These results fall well within the ranges of reported response rates for ovarian ablation and for tamoxifen in similar patient populations. By virtue of its mode of action, goserelin does not stimulate the ovaries and is unlikely to have detrimental effects on the endometrium. In addition, given that goserelin has no oestrogen agonist-like effects, unlike tamoxifen, there is no potential for tumour stimulation in those patients becoming resistant to treatment. Goserelin is generally well tolerated, and the main side-effects are related to ovarian suppression, which is potentially reversible. Preliminary results in premenopausal women with early breast cancer indicate that endocrine treatment with goserelin plus tamoxifen may be as effective as standard combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil), but has significantly less acute toxicity. A number of large, randomized trials are now in progress to assess the potential role of goserelin as adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer."}

During saline tests, ACTH/cortisol levels showed a slight physiological decline in all groups, whereas LH levels remained constant. Naloxone administration significantly increased the plasma levels of ACTH/cortisol and LH in the normal controls, but not in the parkinsonian patients before the dopaminergic treatment. In contrast, dopaminergic therapy restored significant ACTH/cortisol and LH responses to naloxone in parkinsonian patients. In fact, after levodopa plus benserazide, naloxone-induced ACTH, cortisol and LH increments in parkinsonian patients were significantly higher than before therapy and were indistinguishable from those observed in the normal controls.

Objective response rates in heavily pretreated patients with advanced breast cancer generally range between 20 and 30% during treatment with intramuscular formestone 250 or 500mg once every 2 weeks, and a further 20 to 30% of patients experience disease stabilisation. The median duration of response is between 8 and 14 months. Highest response rates are observed in soft tissue metastases, in patients with estrogen-responsive tumours and in those showing a response to previous endocrine therapy. Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that higher response rates are achieved with formestane 500 versus 250mg once every 2 weeks. In comparative studies, the clinical efficacy of intramuscular formestane 250mg did not differ significantly from that of oral megestrol when administered as second-line endocrine therapy to patients with advanced disease in whom previous tamoxifen therapy had failed. In addition, formestane produced a response rate, duration of response and overall survival rate that was not significantly different from that of oral tamoxifen when administered as first-line endocrine therapy to patients with advanced disease, but tamoxifen was superior in some measures. Further investigation of these 2 agents, including the higher dosage of formestane (500mg), is necessary to confirm their relative efficacies. Formestane is well tolerated by the majority of patients; adverse events rarely necessitate cessation of therapy. The most common adverse events are local reactions at the injection site and systemic events usually related to the effect of the drug on the hormonal milieu. The systemic tolerability of formestane is similar to that of tamoxifen but better than that of megestrol. Thus, formestane is effective and well tolerated as first-line endocrine therapy for advanced disease. However, at present, it is unlikely to challenge tamoxifen in this indication, based on recent findings from a large comparative study and the fact that formestane requires intramuscular administration. Nonetheless, formestane, which appears to have a better tolerability profile than other currently available second-line agents (including megestrol and the aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide), is a valuable drug for the second-line treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer."}

In the present study, we investigated the association between COX-2 and MDR1 expression in endometrial cancers and evaluated the effects of the COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac, in combination with paclitaxel on paclitaxel-resistant endometrial cancer cells. The relationship between COX-2 and MDR1 mRNA expression was examined by quantitative PCR in 36 endometrial cancer specimens. The paclitaxel-resistant cell line OMC-2P was established from OMC-2 cells. Paclitaxel (1 \u00b5g/ml) with or without etodolac (10 \u00b5g/ml) was added to OMC-2 and OMC-2P cells, and COX-2 and MDR1 mRNA expression levels were examined. The concentration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the supernatant of each cell line was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The function of MDR1 was determined by intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 using flow cytometry, and the concentration of intracellular paclitaxel was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. We found a positive relationship between COX-2 and MDR1 mRNA expression in endometrial cancer. Both COX-2 mRNA expression and PGE2 production were elevated in resistant OMC-2P cells when compared to non-resistant OMC-2 cells. Additionally, MDR1 mRNA expression was markedly upregulated in OMC-2P cells. In OMC-2 cells, COX-2 and MDR1 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated by paclitaxel treatment and downregulated by co-administration with etodolac. In OMC-2P cells, COX-2 mRNA expression was also significantly upregulated by paclitaxel treatment and tended to be downregulated by co-administration with etodolac. Moreover, co-administration of paclitaxel and etodolac suppressed the induction of MDR1 mRNA. Rhodamine 123 efflux was increased in OMC-2P cells when compared to the efflux in the OMC-2 cells and was increased in response to paclitaxel treatment. Co-administration of paclitaxel and etodolac in both cell lines resulted in decreased rhodamine 123 efflux. The actual concentration of intracellular paclitaxel in OMC-2P cells was significantly lower than that in OMC-2 cells treated with paclitaxel alone and was significantly increased after co-administration of paclitaxel and etodolac. These findings suggest that paclitaxel resistance may be associated with COX-2 and MDR1 expression in cancer cells. Co-administration of COX-2 inhibitors and paclitaxel may have a key role in modulating or overcoming paclitaxel resistance in endometrial cancers."}

Early data suggest a possible dose-response relationship for paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer, but the optimal dose has not yet been defined. The optimal duration of infusional paclitaxel treatment is also not yet known. A study of 96-hour infusional paclitaxel in the treatment of doxorubicin- or mitoxantrone-refractory metastatic breast cancer patients has demonstrated a 48% response rate suggesting that prolonged exposures to paclitaxel may offer a therapeutic advantage. Randomized trials of 3- vs 96-hour paclitaxel are ongoing or planned. The relative efficacy of paclitaxel versus standard chemotherapy as front-line or salvage therapy for metastatic breast cancer is currently under study. In addition, two randomized trials are under way in node positive breast cancer patients to study whether treatment with paclitaxel following standard or high dose doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide adjuvant therapy results in improved patient benefit. Combining paclitaxel with other active agents in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer is an area of active investigation. Combined paclitaxel and doxorubicin, administered concurrently or sequentially, is associated with modest complete response rates in metastatic breast cancer patients. Sequential paclitaxel-->doxorubicin administration is associated with more mucositis than is doxorubicin-->paclitaxel when paclitaxel is administered over 24 hours. High doses of cyclophosphamide can be combined with 24- or 72-hour infusional paclitaxel, and phase II studies of this combination are warranted. Early data suggest that administering biweekly paclitaxel and cisplatin to previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients is associated with high response rates, and confirmatory studies of this combination and schedule are planned. Preclinical data suggest that cell cycle considerations may be important in combining doxorubicin and possibly other agents with paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is an excellent substrate for P-glycoprotein, the protein product of the multidrug resistance-1 (mdr-1) gene, and phase I trials are under way combining paclitaxel with several known blockers of Pgp function. Finally, pilot studies are under way to determine whether the radiation sensitizing effects of paclitaxel can be exploited as part of radiation therapy for patients with locally advanced breast cancer."}

Resistance to beta-lactam drugs, clindamycin, tetracyclines, and 5-nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) has been observed. The prime mechanism for resistance to beta-lactam agents is the production of beta-lactamases. Resistance to clindamycin is mediated by modification of the ribosome. Tetracycline resistance is mediated by both tetracycline efflux and ribosomal protection. 5-Nitroimidazole resistance appears to be caused by a combination of decreased antibiotic uptake and decreased nitroreductase activity. The level of chloramphenicol susceptibility remains quite high, whereas uniform resistance to aminoglycosides and quinolones is observed. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical for both informed selection of antimicrobial therapy and the design of new antimicrobial agents."}

Furthermore, the combined use of L-Asp with MA therapy further potentiated the inhibition of cell proliferation while increasing the induction of apoptosis. These findings provide evidence for the potential antitumor effect of L-Asp in AML, and indicate that improved efficacy maybe achieved by combining L-Asp with MIT and Ara-c.

In preclinical models, cabazitaxel, a second-generation taxane, demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity when compared with docetaxel. In subsequent clinical trials, cabazitaxel was associated with pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profiles consistent with those of previous taxanes. In the pivotal phase III study(TROPIC; NCT00417079), cabazitaxel led to significantly improved overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer(mCRPC), compared with mitoxantrone, when both were administered in combination with prednisone/prednisolone(median survival: 15.1 months[95%confidence interval(CI): 14.1-16.3]vs 12.7 months[95% CI: 11.6-13.7], hazard ratio(HR): 0.70[95% CI: 0.59-0.83], p<0.0001), and it also extended progression-free survival. Furthermore, a long-term analysis of the TROPIC trial revealed that the survival benefit with cabazitaxel was maintained at 2 years, with 60(15.9%)patients in the cabazitaxel group and 31(8.2%)patients in the mitoxantrone group surviving for B2 years(odds ratio: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.33-3.33). Cabazitaxel also provides pain palliation similar to that provided by using mitoxantrone. The safety profile of cabazitaxel is consistent with that of first-generation taxanes, and gastrointestinal(predominantly diarrhea)and hematologic(mainly neutropenia)adverse events are the most frequently reported. Clinical trial data suggest that these events can be managed with careful monitoring and dose reduction where necessary. In addition, treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF)can mitigate hematologic adverse events, whereas supportive treatment with antiemetic and antidiarrheal agents may ameliorate gastrointestinal symptoms. The treatment paradigm for mCRPC is evolving rapidly with the emergence of data for new agents, leading to maximization of patient benefits. The proven efficacy and tolerability profiles of cabazitaxel suggest the promising role of this agent within this paradigm. "}

To clarify this point we carried out a double-blind sequential study in seven healthy volunteers. METHODS. After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee and the written consent of the volunteers, 1.25 mg/kg enoximone or saline was infused intravenously over a period of 20 min using a randomized crossover design with an interval of at least 5 days between the two trials. Twenty minutes after administration of the drug, 250 micrograms ACTH was injected. Plasma cortisol was measured prior to stimulation of the adrenal cortex and 30, 60 and 120 min afterwards; levels of aldosterone and 11-desoxy-cortisol were determined after 60 min. Standard radioimmunoassays were used. Haemodynamic parameters were measured non-invasively. RESULTS. In contrast to the placebo, enoximone resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) increase in the cardiac index (from 3.2 +/- 0.7 to 3.9 +/- 0.9 l min-1 m-2) and heart rate (from 69 +/- 11 to 81 +/- 8 min-1) and a decrease in peripheral resistance (from 1120 +/- 202 to 894 +/- 183 dyn s cm-5); blood pressure fell only slightly. Following injection of ACTH there were significant increases in cortisol (from 63 +/- 29 to 274 +/- 58 micrograms/l), aldosterone (from 86 +/- 37 to 300 +/- 105 ng/l) (both P < 0.001) and 11-desoxycortisol (from 5.3 +/- 1.2 to 9.8 +/- 4.6 micrograms/l; P < 0.05). There was no difference between enoximone and placebo at any time (P > 0.2). CONCLUSIONS. This study confirms the inodilation caused by enoximone. The normal response to ACTH rules out a direct inhibitory effect of a loading dose of 1.25 mg enoximone on the adrenal cortex. As the concentration of the major metabolite of enoximone, the sulphoxide, has been shown to surmount that of the parent drug after 40 min, this also holds true for the metabolite. We conclude that in contrast to etomidate, which causes a substantial reversible adrenal suppression after a single dose of 0.2 mg/kg, enoximone 1.25 mg/kg did not interfere with corticosteroid synthesis or release. Taking into account the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of this inodilator, there is no reason to expect an inhibitory effect even after repeated dosage."}

However, the clinical benefits are modest; despite a doubling of response rates and significant prolongation of progression free survival times, no increase in overall survival is attained. This review summarizes some of the possibilities to account for this discrepant result. These include rapid development of acquired drug resistance due to the redundancy of proangiogenic growth factors, acceleration of tumor growth after antiangiogenic drug treatments are stopped, and increases in tumor cell malignant aggressiveness driven by mechanisms such as increased tumor hypoxia. Some possible strategies to improve the benefits of antiangiogenic drug therapy are discussed such as prolonging the treatment beyond tumor progression, combination with other therapeutic modalities, e.g. long term ('maintenance') low-dose metronomic chemotherapy or additional targeted/biologic drugs, e.g. trastuzumab."}

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters but have also impact on glycosylation of such proteins. Doxorubicin is a substrate for ABC transporters like P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) which is present in human RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells. It was therefore the aim of this study to identify the compartmentalisation and action of doxorubicin in simvastatin-treated RD cells. Due to autofluorescence of doxorubicin, intracellular distribution was monitored by confocal microscopy. The biological effects were traced on the level of colony formation, caspase activation and DNA injury. Here we show that simvastatin treatment leads to ABCB1 inhibition and down-regulation of the transporter. Consequently, these cells accumulate significant amounts of doxorubicin, predominantly in the nucleus and lysosomes. While clearance of the anthracycline into lysosomes is not altered by simvastatin treatment, it significantly enhanced nuclear accumulation in a HMG-CoA reductase-independent manner. Thus, in such treated cells, topoisomerase II activity is significantly inhibited, which is further corroborated by augmented double-strand DNA breaks. Moreover, colony formation was synergistically inhibited by the combination of simvastatin and doxorubicin. Given the fact that ABCB1 expression correlates with an adverse prognosis in many tumours, adjuvant chemotherapy including statins might represent a novel therapeutic concept to overcome ABCB1-mediated multidrug resistance by direct inhibition and down-regulation."}

Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent, is a front-line chemotherapeutic drug for the clinical treatment of GBM; however, its effects are very limited because of the chemoresistance. Valproic acid (VPA), an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor activity, has been shown to have synergistic effects with TMZ against GBM. The mechanism of action of VPA on TMZ combination therapy is still unclear. Accumulating evidence has shown that secreted proteins are responsible for the cross talking among cells in the tumor microenvironment, which may play a critical role in the regulation of drug responses."}

The initial formulation of trastuzumab was intravenous, but presently, a subcutaneous formulation (Herceptin SC) is available. Insufficient data on the response rate and cardiotoxic effects of trastuzumab among indigenous Black populations exist. In all studies evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, indigenous Black populations in Africa were not included, yet they are the ones most likely to benefit from highly effective cancer medicines. This is partly due to poor oncology clinical trial infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa. The ARETTA study protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03879577) is a phase II multicenter feasibility study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles plus trastuzumab in 60 previously untreated women with nonmetastatic breast cancer. The primary endpoint is to assess the proportion of patients with complete pathologic response. Secondary endpoints include the number of patients who require dose delays in docetaxel and trastuzumab attributed to hematologic, GI, and cardiac toxicity. Pharmacokinetic profiles of subcutaneous trastuzumab will also be determined. The ARETTA study will provide important information on the clinical response and cardiac safety of subcutaneous trastuzumab in combination with docetaxel among indigenous African women with nonmetastatic breast cancer.

The data were analyzed with the aid of an isobologram using the concept of an envelope of additivity (G. G. Steel and M. J. Peckman, Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., 5:85-91, 1979). Simultaneous exposure of VCR and MTX produced subadditive or mutually protective interactions. Sequential exposure to VCR first followed immediately by MTX produced similar interactions. When the interval of VCR exposure first and then MTX was increased from 0 to 3, 8, and 24 h, the inhibition of cell growth moved from protection and subadditivity to additivity only. The reversed order of exposure to the 2 drugs produced an entirely different picture. Thus, when the interval of MTX exposure first followed by VCR increased from 0 to 3, 8, and 24 h, the inhibitory effects of the combination changed progressively from the area of subadditivity to the area of supraadditivity. When these data were evaluated using median effect plot analyses (T-C. Chou and P. Talalay. In: New Avenues in Developmental Cancer Chemotherapy, pp. 36-64. Orlando, FL: Academic Press, 1987), strongly synergistic interaction of this sequence at space intervals was confirmed. These data show that the synergistic effects were produced only when MTX was followed 8 or 24 h later by VCR. Other schedules were only additive or even antagonistic. Simultaneous exposure of VCR with daunorubicin, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, or bleomycin also had subadditive and protective effects. VCR, followed by daunorubicin with the interval of 24 h and vice versa, was again subadditive and protective. VCR, followed by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine with the interval of 24 h and vice versa, was again subadditive or additive only. Simultaneous and continuous exposures of VCR with vinblastine or L-asparaginase were only marginally supraadditive."}

Two subtypes of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors have been defined on the basis of their differential pharmacological properties. The current study was undertaken to address the question as to whether the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by captopril and the AT1 and AT2 receptor blockers losartan and PD123319 modulate MI/R-induced infarct size in an in vivo rat model. To produce necrosis, a branch of the descending left coronary artery was occluded for 30 min followed by two hours of reperfusion. ECG changes, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the experiment. Captopril (3 mg/kg), losartan (2 mg/kg), and PD123319 (20 \u03bcg/kg/min) were given in an IV 10 min before ischemia and were continued during the ischemic period. The infarcted area was measured by TTC staining. The volume of infarct and the risk zone was determined by planimetry. Compared to the control group (55.62\u00b14.00%) both captopril and losartan significantly reduced the myocardial infarct size (30.50\u00b13.26% and 37.75\u00b14.44%), whereas neither PD123319 nor PD123319+losartan affected the infarct size volume (46.50\u00b13.72% and 54.62\u00b12.43%). Our data indicates that captopril and losartan exert cardioprotective activity after an MI/R injury. Also, infarct size reduction by losartan was halted by a blockade of the AT2 receptor. Therefore, the activation of AT2 receptors may be potentially protective and appear to oppose the effects mediated by the AT1 receptors."}

This evidence has prompted the design of a specific trial, i.e., the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial, to test metformin as an anti-ageing molecule. However, a unifying or prevailing mechanism of action of metformin is still debated. Here, we summarize the epidemiological data linking metformin to ARD prevention. Then, we dissect the deeply studied mechanisms of action explaining its antihyperglycemic effect and the putative mechanisms supporting its anti-ageing properties, focusing on studies using clinically pertinent doses. We hypothesize that the molecular observations obtained in different models with metformin could be indirectly mediated by its effect on gut flora. Novel evidence suggests that metformin reshapes the human microbiota, promoting the growth of beneficial bacterial species and counteracting the expansion of detrimental bacterial species. In turn, this action would influence the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory circulating factors, thereby promoting glycaemic control and healthy ageing. This framework may reconcile diverse observations, providing information for designing further studies to elucidate the complex interplay between metformin and the metabiome harboured in mammalian body compartments, thereby paving the way for innovative, bacterial-based therapeutics to manage type 2 diabetes and foster a longer healthspan."}

Hp increases the risk of ulcer in patients receiving an NSAID and the effects of Hp and NSAIDs are additive. Following GI bleeding in a patient receiving a conventional NSAID, the eradication of Hp does not make it possible to protect the patient from another episode of GI bleeding and proves to be a much less effective therapy than continuous therapy with proton pump inhibitors. ROLE OF COX-2 INHIBITORS: COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, rofecoxib) are associated with a major decrease in the number of symptomatic and/or complicated ulcers compared to a conventional NSAID. Two randomized studies using doses four times higher than those recommended, have demonstrated that serious GI complications associated with NSAIDs (perforation, GI bleeding) were decreased by half compared to those by use of a conventional NSAID at the usual therapeutic dosage. Considering the patient's previous history of GI disorders prior to initiation of treatment and Hp(+) serology, it appears that decreasing risk of symptomatic or complicated gastro-duodenal ulcer was higher in treatment with Rofexocib in patients who did not have a previous history of ulcer, whatever their Hp status. On the other hand, in the group with a history of GI disorders, the decrease in the risk of ulcer was lower than in patients who were Hp(+). ROLE OF ASPIRIN: The causal relationship between intake of aspirin and Hp appear to be more complex. Thus, it appears that eradication of Hp in patients who presented with GI bleeding and scheduled to resume low-dose aspirin had the same efficacy as a daily dose of 20 mg of omeprazole for a 6-month period."}

On 3 separate days, a dose-response curve to inhaled salbutamol (100 microg puff-1), ipratropium bromide (20 microg puff-1) or placebo was constructed 3h after inhalation of the last dose of tiotropium, using one puff, one puff, two puffs and two puffs, for a total cumulative dose of 600 microg salbutamol or 120 microg ipratropium bromide. Doses were given at 30-min intervals and measurements made 15 min after each dose. At the highest cumulative dose, salbutamol showed a trend to be more effective than ipratropium bromide in improving FEV(1) (0.157 L vs 0.125 L), and reducing sRaw (-4.52 kPa/s vs 3.57 kPa/s), although the differences between the two treatments were always not significant (p>0.05), whereas there was no substantial difference between the two drugs in changing FVC (0.179 L vs 0.168 L), IC (0.254 L vs 0.240 L), TGV (-0.444 L vs -0.441 L), TLC (-0.334 L vs -0.318 L) and RV (-0.467 L vs -0.498 L).

Our results indicate that there is not much difference in bronchodilation between adding higher than conventional doses of salbutamol or ipratropium bromide to tiotropium in patients with stable COPD. Effective improvement of the pulmonary function may be achieved in such a type of patients by adding salbutamol 600 microg or ipratropium bromide 120 microg to regular tiotropium. These is an interesting finding mainly for those COPD patients suffering from cardiovascular co-morbidities that are at highest risk of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death when treated with elevated doses of a beta(2)-agonist (EudraCT number: 2007-001597-82)."}

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is the principle target for drugs like sunitinib, sorafenib and bevacizumab. As VEGF is regulating dendritic cell (DC) function, inhibition of VEGF results in activation of DCs and a shift towards cellular (type 1) immunity, which is believed to favor cancer rejection. Recent studies have established the immune-stimulating effects of sunitinib that may as well be a marker for effectiveness. On the other hand, sorafenib not only inhibits VEGF receptor (VEGFR) but is also a B-Raf inhibitor (a component of the ras - MAPK pathway) and this leads to downregulation of immune responses. Sorafenib has not yet shown benefit in first-line treatment of mRCC when compared to interferon (IFN)-alpha and sorafenib-mediated immunosuppression may partially account for that. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the target of temsirolimus, is an element of the DC activation pathway. There are no data for in vivo effects of temsirolimus in the immune system. The addition of IFN-alpha to temsirolimus resulted in inferior outcomes than temsirolimus alone. IFN-alpha has however still a place in mRCC treatment, as bevacizumab has been approved in combination with IFN-alpha. New clinical trials address the effects of the combination of cytokines with targeted agents. The immune-modulating effects of targeted treatments may be important in pharmacodynamic outcomes, effectiveness or the development of adverse events."}

Combining acetylcholine with clonidine did not alter the inhibitory effect of clonidine but the combination of acetylcholine with yohimbine or idazoxan abolished the marked enhancing effects of yohimbine or idazoxan on S-I efflux. These findings indicate that there may be a reciprocal interaction between prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptors and prejunctional muscarinic cholinoceptors."}

There is growing interest in 'value for money', which can be assessed economically by comparing the costs and consequences of alternative courses of action. A number of different economic evaluation methods may be used: cost-minimization (only costs examined with no consideration given to consequences); cost-effectiveness (in which a unidimensional clinical outcome is assessed, for example, life-years gained); cost-utility (multidimensional outcomes measured, for example quantity and quality of life); and cost-benefit (where outcome is considered in monetary terms). Ulcer disease offers several examples of how economic evaluation can be used to address issues related to efficiency and value for money in healthcare. In a study of reflux oesophagitis, omeprazole was shown to be more cost-effective than ranitidine in a 12-week treatment study. With omeprazole the costs were lower and the effectiveness better than with the H2-receptor antagonist. In a later study the cost-effectiveness of omeprazole and ranitidine are compared for both intermittent and maintenance treatment in reflux oesophagitis. Using a Markov chain approach, Swedish cost data and studying a time period of 12 months, it found that omeprazole is both more effective in providing healthy days and less costly than ranitidine for both treatment strategies. The comparison between intermittent treatment and maintenance treatment with omeprazole shows that the latter is more effective but also more costly. It is concluded that the relative cost-effectiveness of omeprazole maintenance treatment increases with the risk of relapse when off treatment, the severity of symptoms following relapse, and the value of healthy days, i.e. days free from reflux oesophagitis. A model analysis comparing Helicobacter pylori eradication with conventional treatments in patients with duodenal ulcer disease has shown H. pylori eradication to be cost-effective when compared with either episodic therapy using omeprazole or maintenance therapy with ranitidine. The study used a Markov chain approach, and included the cost of treatment, in Swedish crowns, in a Swedish primary care setting over a period of 5 years. In the analysis, patients receiving conventional therapy were initially healed with omeprazole, 20-40 mg once daily. Following healing patients were either treated with further courses of omeprazole upon relapse or were given maintenance treatment with ranitidine, 150 mg once daily. The patients who were assigned to the H. pylori eradication therapy group were initially given an H. pylori test. Those patients who proved positive for the bacterium received omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily, plus amoxicillin, 2000 mg daily in divided doses, for 2 weeks, followed by omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, for a further 2 weeks to ensure healing. Patients who were H. pylori-negative were assigned to receive either episodic or maintenance therapy as described above. The model assumption applied in the H. pylori eradication group was that, following successful healing and H. pylori eradication, virtually all patients were cured and experienced no relapse during the following 5 years. by contrast, almost all the patients assigned to episodic therapy relapsed, and during maintenance therapy with H2-receptor antagonists, most patients experienced at least one relapse. Although H. pylori eradication resulted in initial higher costs than the alternative strategies, it reduced the risk of recurrence and for most patients there were no future costs. The investment therefore paid off within a relatively short period of time. Even when unfavourable assumptions were made, such as an H. pylori eradication rate of only 50%, the H. pylori eradication strategy had a pay-off period of less than 1.3 years compared with maintenance treatment, and 3 years compared with episodic"}

Results showed that the 5-HTT mRNA expression was much higher in T-cell and B-cell lines than that in a monocytic cell line.

The bile-acid sequestrants--cholestyramine and colestipol--primarily decrease LDL cholesterol by binding bile acids, thereby decreasing intrahepatic cholesterol, and by increasing the activity of LDL receptors. Nicotinic acid lowers LDL cholesterol and triglyceride by decreasing VLDL synthesis and by decreasing free fatty acid mobilization from peripheral adipocytes. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors--fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin--lower LDL cholesterol by partially inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis) and by increasing the activity of LDL receptors.

The bile-acid sequestrants may cause constipation, reflux oesophagitis, and dyspepsia, and may bind coadministered medications such as digitalis glycosides, beta blockers, warfarin, and exogenous thyroid hormone. Nicotinic acid use is commonly associated with flushing and pruritus and may also cause non-specific gastrointestinal complaints, hepatotoxicity (hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, or elevated liver enzymes), gout, myolysis, decreased glucose tolerance and increased fasting glucose levels, and ophthalmological complications including decreased visual acuity, toxic amblyopia, and cystic maculopathy. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may produce liver enzyme elevations, creatine kinase elevations and rhabdomyolysis. The combination of a reductase inhibitor and a fibrate increases the risk for rhabdomyolysis.

Resveratrol can also inhibit tumor growth by regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The present study investigated the anti-tumor effects of the combined use of rapamycin and resveratrol in papillary thyroid cancer. We first treated two human papillary thyroid cancer cell lines (KTC-1 and TPC-1) with single or combined administration, and examined the effects on proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis, and invasion/migration of papillary thyroid cancer cells. A mouse xenograft model was induced with KTC-1 and TPC-1\u00a0cells followed by treatment with single or combined administration. Body weight and tumor size were monitored to assess the toxicity of each compound. The phosphorylation of AKT and the mTORC1 target p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) in tumors was also examined. Both rapamycin and resveratrol inhibited proliferation, altered the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis of papillary thyroid cancer cells. Invasion and migration were also reduced, as was the tumor growth rate in the xenograft model. Co-administration significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effects than use of any one drug, and significantly reduced the phosphorylation of AKT and p70S6K compared to treatment with rapamycin alone. Overall, compared to single use of rapamycin or resveratrol, co-administration had a synergistic effect in inhibiting proliferation and invasion/migration of papillary thyroid cancer cells and inducing apoptosis. Resveratrol is sensitizing the anti-tumor effects of rapamycin and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is involved. Although further animal and clinical studies are needed to clarify the mechanism and assess drug safety, the present study suggests that the combination of rapamycin and resveratrol may be a promising strategy for the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer."}

Isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. It has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. MIC(90)s for most species of Enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/L, significantly lower than those of imipenem. MIC(90)s for most Bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L, and MIC(90)s were species specific for Clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/L for Clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/L for Clostridium clostridioforme. Ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus). Ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in Gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in Gram-negative organisms."}

To assess whether 5IA has neuroprotective properties, we examined the effect of 5IA on glutamate (Glu)-induced neurotoxicity using primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. A 10-min exposure of cultures to Glu followed by 2-h incubation with drug-free medium caused a marked loss of viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion method. Glu-induced neurotoxicity was prevented by 5IA both in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. 5IA-induced neuroprotection required pretreatment of 5IA prior to Glu exposure with an optimal concentration of 10 nM and an optimal pretreatment time of 2 h. Treatment after Glu exposure could not rescue the cultured cells. The neuroprotective effect of 5IA was antagonized by mecamylamine, a nAChR antagonist, but not by scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Dihydro-beta-erythroidine, an alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR antagonist, completely inhibited 5IA-induced neuroprotection, whereas alpha-bungarotoxin, an alpha 7 nAChR antagonist, had no effect. Furthermore, 5IA did not show neuroprotective effects in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of 5IA are produced by activation of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs followed by the influx of extracellular Ca2+. In conclusion, 5IA is possibly not only useful for the treatment and prevention of glutamate neurotoxicity, but also as an available tool for elucidating the mechanism of neuroprotection associated with alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs."}

To this end, cytoplasmic ribosomes were prepared from rat liver. In vitro, poly(U)-directed ribosome protein synthesis was studied in the presence and absence of selected aminoglycosides. Misreading of poly(U) was also assessed. Consistent with earlier studies using different sources of ribosomes, paromomycin inhibited cell-free protein synthesis and caused poly(U) misreading. In contrast to the findings of other studies in cell-free ribosomes of eukaryotic organisms, netilmicin, tobramycin, and neomycin were most active in inhibiting protein synthesis, and gentamicin C2 and neomycin caused appreciable misreading. Thus the previous suggestion that a paromamine fragment (found in paromomycin) might be a structural requirement for in vitro inhibition of protein synthesis and misreading is not substantiated by the results in rat liver ribosomes. Commercial gentamicin C is a mixture of gentamicins C1, C1a, and C2. Despite nearly identical chemical structures, the three constituents displayed greatly different propensities for inducing poly(U) misreading. C2 was the most active, followed by C1a. In summary, selected aminoglycoside antibiotics caused inhibition and mistranslation of poly(U) messenger in an in vitro ribosome system prepared from rat liver. These effects were not limited to paromamine-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics. Gentamicin C2 caused much more poly(U) misreading than the other two constituents of the gentamicin C complex."}

Acetylcholine (ACh), other cholinomimetics, cholinesterase inhibitors and cholinergic antagonists were administered iontophoretically to medial geniculate (MG) neurones and their effects on chemically or neurally evoked responses recorded extracellularly.2. Acetylcholine had excitant actions on 45% of the neurones tested. Most of these were of a slow time course. Desensitization to the excitant effects was frequently observed.3. Acetylcholine excited 91% of neurones activated antidromically by stimulation of the auditory cortex, 71% of neurones activated synaptically from the auditory cortex, 74% of neurones activated from the inferior colliculus and 100% of geniculo-cortical relay neurones.4. Acetylcholine had depressant effects, which were generally of a rapid time course, on 29% of MG neurones. No desensitization to the depressant effects was observed.5. On 4% of neurones, ACh had both excitant and depressant effects. Such \"dual\" effects were manifested either as an initial excitation followed by a depression, or as a depression followed by an excitation.6. Eserine, neostigmine and edrophonium potentiated both excitant and depressant actions of ACh on many cells. Neostigmine and edrophonium occasionally antagonized the effects of ACh.7. Atropine, hyoscine, dihydro-beta-erythroidine, hexamethonium and (+)-tubocurarine antagonized both excitant and depressant effects of ACh. The muscarinic blocking agents were usually more effective than the nicotinic agents.8. Carbamylcholine, acetyl-beta-methylcholine, nicotine, butyrylcholine, arecoline and pilocarpine had excitant, depressant or no effects on MG neurones. Generally, carbamylcholine was more potent than acetyl-beta-methylcholine and ACh, which were more potent than nicotine. Butyrylcholine, arecoline and pilocarpine were even less potent, often having no effect.9. The cholinomimetics generally had similar effects to those of ACh on the same neurones, but sometimes were quite different. Carbamylcholine, acetyl-beta-methylcholine and nicotine antagonized the effects of ACh on some neurones.10. The results suggest that cholinoceptive receptors on MG neurones are not homogeneous. Although there are possibly some purely muscarinic and purely nicotinic receptors, the majority appear to be of intermediate muscarinic-nicotinic type. These mediate either excitation or inhibition."}

Its characteristics (i.e., magnitude, anion selectivity, and block) were studied with intracellular microelectrode techniques. Under control conditions, the apical membrane conductance (Ga) was 0.17 mS.cm-2, primarily ascribable to GaK. With elevation of cell cAMP to maximum levels, Ga increased to 6.7 mS.cm-2 and became anion selective, with the permeability sequence SCN- > NO3- > I- > Br- > Cl- >> SO4(2-) approximately gluconate approximately cyclamate. GaCl was not affected by the putative Cl- channel blockers Cu2+, DIDS, DNDS, DPC, furosemide, IAA-94, MK-196, NPPB, SITS, verapamil, and glibenclamide. To characterize the cAMP-activated Cl- channels, patch-clamp studies were conducted on the apical membrane of enzyme-treated gallbladders or on dissociated cells from tissues exposed to both theophylline and forskolin. Two kinds of Cl- channels were found. With approximately 100 mM Cl- in both bath and pipette, the most frequent channel had a linear current-voltage relationship with a slope conductance of approximately 10 pS. The less frequent channel was outward rectifying with slope conductances of approximately 10 and 20 pS at -40 and 40 mV, respectively. The Cl- channels colocalized with apical maxi-K+ channels in 70% of the patches. The open probability (Po) of both kinds of Cl- channels was variable from patch to patch (0.3 on average) and insensitive to [Ca2+], membrane voltage, and pH. The channel density (approximately 0.3/patch) was one to two orders of magnitude less than that required to account for GaCl. However, addition of 250 U/ml protein kinase A plus 1 mM ATP to the cytosolic side of excised patches increased the density of the linear 10-pS Cl- channels more than 10-fold to four per patch and the mean Po to 0.5, close to expectations from GaCl. The permeability sequence and blocker insensitivity of the PKA-activated channels were identical to those of the apical membrane.

It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-\u03b1 and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, PNET and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit mTOR kinase activity and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are also being developed. In this review, we aim to survey relevant research, the molecular mechanisms of signalling, including upstream activation and downstream effectors, and the role of mTOR in cancer, mainly in melanoma."}

A lower dose of 400 mg m(-2) bolus + 2400 mg m(-2) infusion which, like dG produces minimal toxicity, was chosen for the OxMdG combination. Fluorouracil exposure (AUC(0-48 h)) at this lower dose is equivalent to dG. With OxMdG, grade 3-4 toxicity was rare (neutropenia 2.8% cycles; vomiting or diarrhoea <1% cycles), but despite this there were two infection-associated deaths.

They are a heterogeneous group of diseases, ranging from highly malignant and frequently fatal to histologically benign and curable by surgery alone. A uniform treatment approach to these tumors is not practical, due to their histological and biological heterogeneity. Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are best treated with maximally safe surgical resection, generally achievable for hemispheric or cerebellar locations. Patients with deep midline, optic pathway/hypothalamic, and brain stem locations should undergo subtotal resection or biopsy only. If a complete resection is not feasible, subtotal resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy is the standard approach; however, observation alone with serial neuroimaging is used in some asymptomatic, surgically inaccessible lesions. Chemotherapy is used first-line in cases of residual or progressive disease, to avoid or delay radiation therapy and its associated side effects. Regimens demonstrating objective responses and increased progression free survival (PFS) include carboplatin and vincristine (CV), thioguanine/procarbazine/CCNU/vincristine (TPCV), or weekly vinblastine. High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are less common in children than in adults, though are similar in their aggressive clinical behavior, resistance to therapy, and dismal outcomes. There is not a single \"standard of care\" therapy for non-metastatic HGGs, but generally accepted is an aggressive attempt at a complete surgical resection, followed by multimodality therapy with focal radiation and chemotherapy. The use of temozolomide (TMZ) during and following radiotherapy is common, though it appeared not to improve the outcome in a cooperative group clinical trial when compared to an historical control cohort. The angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab, used alone or in combination with irinotecan, is also commonly used as maintenance therapy after radiation. Current trials are prospectively comparing TMZ to newer agents (vorinostat, bevacizumab) in a randomized phase II trial. Brainstem gliomas are a unique category of childhood gliomas. Approximately 80\u00a0% of childhood brainstem gliomas arise within the pons as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). When biopsied, these are usually HGGs and carry a dismal prognosis. Standard therapy is focal radiation (54-58\u00a0Gy), preferably on a clinical trial testing concurrent chemotherapy or biologic agent. No standard chemotherapy agent has impacted survival. The remaining 20\u00a0% of brainstem gliomas are low-grade, arise in the midbrain, dorsal medulla, or cervicomedullary junction, and are indolent in nature with a much better prognosis. Improvement in the outcome of all childhood gliomas will require increased knowledge of the underlying biology of these tumors, in order to treat with more biologically based and precise therapies."}

A Markov model (6-month cycle length) assessed health and cost outcomes of CZP versus other anti-TNFs recommended for RA in Greece over a patient's lifetime. Following discontinuation of first-line anti-TNF, patients switched to second anti-TNF and then to a biologic with another mode of action. Sequential use of csDMARDs followed third biologic.

Costs (drug acquisition, administration, monitoring, and patient management) were considered for 2014. Results presented are incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) ascertained robustness of base-case findings. Base-case analysis indicated that CZP+MTX was more costly and more effective compared with Etanercept+MTX (base-case ICER: \u20ac3,177 per QALY), whilst versus adalimumab/golimumab, CZP was dominant (less costly, more effective).

In Study 2 sodium bicarbonate 1 g, aluminium hydroxide 1 g, an antacid preparation containing both aluminium and magnesium hydroxides, or water alone were ingested with tolfenamic acid 400 mg. Plasma concentrations of tolfenamic and mefenamic acids and their cumulative excretion in urine were determined up to 24 h. Magnesium hydroxide greatly accelerated, in a dose-dependent manner the absorption of both tolfenamic and mefenamic acids. The peak times in plasma were shortened by about 1 h by 425 mg and 1700 mg magnesium hydroxide, and the peak plasma concentrations of both fenamates were elevated up to 3-fold. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve between 0 and 1 h of tolfenamic acid was increased up to 7-fold and that of mefenamic acid up to 3-fold. The total bioavailability of tolfenamic and mefenamic acids was only slightly increased. Aluminium hydroxide alone and in combination with magnesium hydroxide significantly retarded the absorption and lowered the peak plasma concentration of tolfenamic acid. Sodium bicarbonate had no significant effect on its absorption. The interaction with magnesium hydroxide leads to higher and earlier peak plasma concentrations of the fenamates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Thiazolidinediones like pioglitazone however, are associated with severe side effects. To identify alternate therapeutic strategies for chronic myeloid leukemia we screened FDA-approved drugs in K562 cells and identified the leprosy drug clofazimine as an inhibitor of viability. Here we show that clofazimine induces apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia patient-derived blood mononuclear cells, with particularly robust effect in imatinib-resistant cells. Clofazimine also induced apoptosis in CD34+38- progenitors and quiescent CD34+ cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients but not healthy donor-derived hematopoietic progenitors. Mechanistic evaluation revealed that clofazimine via physical interaction with PPAR\u03b3 induced nuclear factor kB-p65 proteasomal degradation, which led to sequential MYB and peroxiredoxin 1 downregulation and concomitant induction of reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis. Clofazimine also suppressed STAT5 expression and consequently downregulated stem cell maintenance factors hypoxia-inducible factor -1\u03b1 and -2\u03b1 and Cbp/P300 Interacting Transactivator with Glu/Asp rich Carboxy-Terminal Domain 2.

For further biological studies, we reported two simple, alternative methods for the synthesis of the metabolites. The cytotoxic and antiviral activities of resveratrol and its metabolites were compared in cell culture experiments using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

This contraction was markedly inhibited by phentolamine (10(-5) M) or prazosin (10(-6) M) and was accompanied by an increase in tritium efflux from tissue preloaded with [3H]norepinephrine. In the presence of phentolamine, monensin (1-2 X 10(-5) M) or ouabain (1-2 X 10(-5) M) caused only a small and slowly developing contraction. Simultaneous application of these agents caused a more rapid and greater contraction. Either monensin or ouabain gradually increased cellular Na+ and decreased cellular K+ content. When monensin was applied simultaneously with ouabain, there was a rapid increase in cellular Na+ and loss of cellular K+. In high K+ (65.4 mM) solution, monensin (10(-6) M) slightly reduced the increased tension level but when external glucose was omitted monensin markedly inhibited the contraction. A significant decrease in tissue ATP content was observed only when monensin was applied in glucose-free solution. Similarly, hypoxia (N2 bubbling) markedly inhibited the high K+ contraction and decreased the tissue ATP content only in the absence of glucose. These results suggest that monensin produces a neurogenic contraction due to the release of endogenous catecholamines and also produces a myogenic contraction by a decrease in transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients when the Na+-K+ pump is inhibited by ouabain, and that monensin inhibits aerobic energy metabolism of vascular smooth muscle."}

The diagnosis of HG-NHL and the non-response to DHAP resulted to reduce respectively the OS (P = 0.007, RR = 2.8) and PFS probability (P = 0.01, RR = 4.1). In conclusion this outpatient schedule of DHAP is a well tolerated, efficient salvage and mobilizing regimen not only in HG-NHL, but also in LG-NHL and in HD. Randomized studies are needed to better define the role of DHAP in LG-NHL and HD patients."}

Warfarin (or another vitamin K antagonist) and antiplatelet agents are often required in combination for several months. Patients and physicians who have experienced major bleeding complications sometimes question the benefit of these treatment strategies. It is therefore crucial to try and weigh the impact on efficacy against safety. In this review the net benefit is discussed both numerically, comparing absolute reductions vs. increases in risks, and also by addressing the qualitative importance of each component in reaching the net benefit. Except for primary prophylaxis in patients at low-moderate risk for coronary events, there is a net benefit of antithrombotic therapy. With increasing severity of the coronary condition the net benefit generally prevails even with an increasing number of antithrombotic drugs combined. However, as the patient slowly stabilizes after appropriate interventions, it is necessary to de-escalate the treatment in accordance with decreasing net benefit of prolonged combination therapy."}

In isolated working rat hearts, perfusion with ramiprilat (10 nM to 10 microM) reduced the incidence and duration of ventricular fibrillation, and improved cardiodynamics and myocardial metabolism. BK perfusion (0.1 nM to 10 nM) induced comparable cardioprotective effects. In addition, perfusion with ramiprilat (0.1 microM) markedly increased kinin outflow measured by RIA. The beneficial effects of ramiprilat and BK were abolished by the addition of the specific NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA 1 microM) or icatibant (1 nM). Similar results were obtained in dogs, rabbits and rats with myocardial infarction induced by ligation of the left descending coronary artery. The influence of the icatibant on the antihypertrophic effect of ramipril and BK in the LVH was investigated in rats made hypertensive by aortic banding. Ramipril at the antihypertensive dose of 1 mg kg-1 day-1 for 6 weeks prevented the increase in blood pressure and the development of LVH. The lower non-antihypertensive dose of ramipril (10 micrograms kg-1 day-1 for 6 weeks) had no effect on the increase in blood pressure or on plasma ACE activity but also prevented LVH after aortic banding. The antihypertrophic effect of the higher and the lower dose of ramipril as well as the antihypertensive action of the higher dose of ramipril were abolished by coadministration of the icatibant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

In the present study we have employed a microsome-mediated test system concomitantly with DNA adduct detection to assess the efficacy of five chemopreventive agents, N-acetylcysteine, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), curcumin, oltipraz, and ellagic acid. 32P-Postlabeling analysis of DNA incubated with benzo[a]pyrene (BP) in the presence of Aroclor 1254-induced microsomes produced two major adducts: one derived from the interaction of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE) with deoxyguanosine (dG) and the other from further activation of 9-OH-BP (309 and 34 adducts/10(7) nucleotides, respectively). With the exception of N-acetylcysteine, all test agents significantly altered BP-DNA adduct levels: Intervention with ellagic acid and oltipraz substantially (64-94%) inhibited both BPDE-dG and 9-OH-BP adducts, while intervention with curcumin and BHT inhibited the BPDE-dG adduct (57% and 38%, respectively) and enhanced the 9-OH-BP adduct (230% and 650%, respectively). Furthermore, ellagic acid was the only test agent observed to inhibit the anti BPDE-dG adduct in the absence of microsomal enzymes, which is consistent with the known conjugation of ellagic acid with BPDE. These results suggest that oltipraz may be acting as an inhibitor of P4501A1, the isozyme involved in activation of BP to BPDE, or by conjugation of the electrophilic species by a metabolite of oltipraz. A plausible mechanism for inhibition of the BPDE-dG adduct and enhancement of the 9-OH-BP adduct by curcumin and BHT includes inhibition of epoxide hydrolase. Our results also indicate that N-acetylcysteine does not act as an electrophilic trapping agent of BP metabolites but may exert its protective effect in vivo by various other means, including modulation of detoxification enzymes and altering DNA repair processes. These data suggest that this cell-free system in conjunction with the sensitive 32P-postlabeling DNA adduct analysis may prove a viable test system for assessing the mechanisms and efficacy of chemopreventive agents."}

However, the effectiveness of treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin is often limited by chemoresistance. Melatonin suppresses neoplastic growth via different mechanisms in a variety of tumours. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effects of melatonin on rapamycin-induced HNSCC cell death and to identify potential cross-talk pathways. We analysed the dose-dependent effects of melatonin in rapamycin-treated HNSCC cell lines (Cal-27 and SCC-9). These cells were treated with 0.1, 0.5 or 1\u00a0mmol/L melatonin combined with 20 nM rapamycin. We further examined the potential synergistic effects of melatonin with rapamycin in Cal-27 xenograft mice. Relationships between inhibition of the mTOR pathway, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis and mitophagy reportedly increased the cytotoxic effects of rapamycin in HNSCC. Our results demonstrated that combined treatment with rapamycin and melatonin blocked the negative feedback loop from the specific downstream effector of mTOR activation S6K1 to Akt signalling, which decreased cell viability, proliferation and clonogenic capacity. Interestingly, combined treatment with rapamycin and melatonin-induced changes in mitochondrial function, which were associated with increased ROS production, increasing apoptosis and mitophagy. This led to increase cell death and cellular differentiation. Our data further indicated that melatonin administration reduced rapamycin-associated toxicity to healthy cells. Overall, our findings suggested that melatonin could be used as an adjuvant agent with rapamycin, improving effectiveness while minimizing its side effects."}

The trial was also intended to evaluate the response of resistant disease and of stable metastatic disease to a combination of doxorubicin and vinblastine sulfate. The cardiotoxic potential of mitoxantrone was evaluated in all the patients by serial measurements of ejection fraction and by endocardial biopsy of the right ventricle. Patients who achieved a complete response or a partial response (with bone as the only site of disease) on the three-drug combination were continued on this treatment for 2 years, or for 1 year following a complete response, whichever was shorter or as cardiac monitoring permitted. Therapy with doxorubicin, 25 mg/m2/d for two days, followed by continuous infusion vinblastine sulfate, 1.4 mg/m2/d for four days, was given to all patients who progressed after two courses or were stable after six courses of three-drug therapy.

Patients who responded to induction had a median survival of 41 weeks versus 20.6 weeks for the nonresponders, p less than 0.001. Performance status greater than or equal to 60%, and absence of prior radiotherapy were associated with improved survival (30 and 31.5 weeks, respectively). The toxicity of these regimens was acceptable. Failure to improve on results of our earlier protocol were probably due to the long (weeks) interval between treatments, inclusion of a relatively inactive but toxic drug (DTIC) in the induction combination which limited doses of the more active agents, and the use of a non-cross-resistant drug regimen which was inactive."}

Female Wistar rats were fasted 12 hr before experiments and diclofenac (10 and 50 mg/kg), misoprostol (100 microg/kg), celecoxib (30 and 100 mg/kg), saline and the combination of diclofenac (50 mg/kg) plus misoprostol (25, 50 and 100 microg/kg) were administered orally. Nociceptive behavior was assessed during the following hr. Diclofenac and celecoxib dose-dependently reduced formalin-induced nociception reaching similar maximal effects. Moreover, misoprostol did not produce antinociception, but increased diclofenac-induced antinociception. Animals were sacrificed 3 hr following drug administration and stomachs examined to assess gastric damage. Misoprostol did not produce any damage to the stomach. However, diclofenac, but not celecoxib, produced significant gastric damage (number of stomach ulcers) in a dose-dependent fashion. Misoprostol dose-dependently reduced diclofenac-induced ulcers. Data show that diclofenac and celecoxib lead to similar antinociception, with diclofenac being more active to produce gastric damage. However, diclofenac-induced gastric damage can be markedly reduced by misoprostol. In addition to its gastroprotective effect, misoprostol showed a synergic effect on diclofenac-induced anti-nociception. Considering the cardiovascular effects of COX-2 selective inhibitors, the combination of diclofenac and misoprostol could represent a safer and effective alternative for patients with pain."}

This review describes the current knowledge on drug-drug and food-drug interactions with repaglinide and nateglinide. These two meglitinide derivatives, commonly called glinides, have been developed for improving insulin secretion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. They are increasingly used either in monotherapy or in combination with other oral antihyperglycaemic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Compared with sulfonylureas, glinides have been shown to (i) provide a better control of postprandial hyperglycaemia, (ii) overcome some adverse effects, such as hypoglycaemia, and (iii) have a more favourable safety profile, especially in patients with renal failure. The meal-related timing of administration of glinides and the potential influence of food and meal composition on their bioavailability may be important. In addition, some food components (e.g. grapefruit juice) may cause pharmacokinetic interactions. Because glinides are metabolised via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme, they are indeed exposed to pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition to CYP3A4, repaglinide is metabolised via CYP2C8, while nateglinide metabolism also involves CYP2C9. Furthermore, both compounds and their metabolites may undergo specialised transport/uptake in the intestine, another source of pharmacokinetic interactions. Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are those that occur when glinides are administered together with other glucose-lowering agents or compounds widely coadministered to diabetic patients (e.g. lipid-lowering agents), with drugs that are known to induce (risk of lower glinide plasma levels and thus of deterioration of glucose control) or inhibit (risk of higher glinide plasma levels leading to hypoglycaemia) CYP isoenzymes concerned in their metabolism, or with drugs that have a narrow efficacy : toxicity ratio. Pharmacokinetic interactions reported in the literature appear to be more frequent and more important with repaglinide than with nateglinide. Rifampicin (rifampin) reduced repaglinide area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by 32-85% while it reduced nateglinide AUC by almost 25%. Reported increases in AUCs with coadministration of drugs inhibiting CYP isoenzymes never exceeded 80% for repaglinide (except with ciclosporin and with gemfibrozil) and 50% for nateglinide. Ciclosporin more than doubled repaglinide AUC (+144%), a finding that should raise caution when using these two drugs in combination. The most impressive pharmacokinetic interaction was reported with combined administration of gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) and repaglinide (8-fold increase in repaglinide AUC). Although no studies have been performed in patients with type 2 diabetes, the latter combination should be avoided in clinical practice."}

The efficacy of budesonide/formoterol as maintenance therapy in patients with asthma has been examined in several randomised studies.Twice-daily budesonide/formoterol was significantly more effective than an equivalent or higher daily dose of budesonide alone or high-dose fluticasone propionate alone at improving peak expiratory flow (PEF) in adults with predominantly moderate persistent asthma. Symptom control and the risk of mild exacerbations were significantly improved versus budesonide alone. Moreover, budesonide/formoterol appeared to be as effective as concurrent therapy with equivalent dosages of budesonide and formoterol administered via separate inhalers in adults with moderate persistent asthma. Budesonide/formoterol administered once daily was as effective as twice-daily administration (equivalent daily doses) and more effective than once-daily budesonide in adults with moderate persistent asthma. Twice-daily budesonide/formoterol significantly improved PEF compared with budesonide in paediatric patients with asthma. Adjustable maintenance dosing with budesonide/formoterol was associated with significantly less study drug use than fixed dosing with budesonide/formoterol in adults with predominantly mild or moderate persistent asthma. In two of three studies (all longer than 4 months' duration), the risk of exacerbations was significantly lower with adjustable than with fixed dosing, but no difference was detected in four short-term studies. Symptom severity was maintained or improved in most patients receiving either treatment regimen. In adults with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, adjustable maintenance dosing with budesonide/formoterol reduced the rate of exacerbations and reliever medication use compared with fixed dosing with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. Budesonide/formoterol was well tolerated in both fixed and adjustable dosing regimens. In conclusion, in patients with persistent asthma symptoms despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, budesonide/formoterol administered via a single dry powder Turbuhaler device is an effective, well tolerated, convenient treatment option, which may have the potential for improved compliance. It appears to be as effective as treatment with budesonide and formoterol administered via separate inhalers and is more effective than budesonide monotherapy in improving PEF, controlling symptoms and preventing mild exacerbations. Adjustable maintenance dosing with budesonide/formoterol is associated with a lower overall dosage and appears to maintain control as effectively as fixed dosing."}

We conducted a randomized phase III trial to compare efficacy and safety of cladribine and fludarabine, each combined with cyclophosphamide, in previously untreated progressive CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients received cladribine at 0.12 mg/kg combined with cyclophosphamide at 250 mg/m(2) for 3 days intravenously (CC regimen) or fludarabine at 25 mg/m(2) combined with cyclophosphamide at 250 mg/m(2) for 3 days intravenously (FC regimen), every 28 days for up to six cycles. The primary end point was complete response (CR) rate. Secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS Of 423 randomly assigned patients (211 to CC and 212 to FC), 395 were evaluated in the final analysis. The CR and ORR reached 47% and 88% in the CC arm and 46% and 82% in the FC arm (P = .25 and P = .11, respectively). The median PFS was 2.34 years with CC and 2.27 years with FC (P = .51). OS and grade 3/4 treatment-related toxicity were also comparable. Moreover, we did not observe any significant differences in CC and FC efficacy across different patient prognostic subgroups that included patients with 17p13 (TP53 gene) deletion who had poor survival in both study arms. CONCLUSION Cladribine and fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide are equally effective and safe first-line regimens for progressive CLL.

It has been well established that atorvastatin and probucol could elicit a variety of biological effects through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties respectively. This study was to examine whether probucol and atorvastatin in combination had the enhanced protective effect against cerebral ischemia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Experiment 1 was used to evaluate the time course expression of Peroxiredoxin2 (Prx2) and Foxo3a after cerebral ischemia. Experiment 2 was used to detect neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin and probucol in cerebral ischemia. At 24h or 72h, neurologic deficit, brain water content and infarct size were measured. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, Western blot and confocal microscope were used to analyze the expressions of Prx2, Foxo3a and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Compared with the normal-control group, the expressions of Prx2 and Foxo3a were down-regulated in ischemic brain. Compared with the use of probucol or atorvastatin alone, the combined treatment dramatically reduced the brain water content and the infarct volume (P<0.05).

Treatment of severe valvular disease has historically required surgical correction, which carries its own risks, but there have been significant advances in valve replacement technologies and techniques, most notably the development of percutaneous options for repair and replacement. While valve replacements alleviate the hemodynamic burden of valvular disease, the synthetic material comprising part or all of the replacement valve provides nidus for clot, necessitating antithrombotic therapy. Providing the right balance between thromboembolic and bleeding risk is made more challenging by the comorbidities that often co-exist with valve disease in the elderly patient. The backbone of anticoagulation regimens has been comprised of aspirin, warfarin, or both, but newer agents are gaining popularity due to improved convenience and safety profiles. The expanding medical arsenal brings not only more options but also more complexity with the increasing number of possible combinations of anticoagulants and valve types. In general, mechanical heart valves are thought to be the most durable option with the highest thrombotic risk, requiring anticoagulation with warfarin with the addition of aspirin. Bioprosthetic valves placed surgically or percutaneously are less likely to cause thrombus and have been successfully managed with antiplatelet agents alone. However, concerns about previously undetected complications coming to light with new imaging techniques have brought uncertainty about current practice. In order to provide optimal care for our patients, careful review of the current literature, guideline recommendations, and the thrombotic and bleeding risk unique to the individual patient and valve type is necessary."}

L-type calcium channels in vascular cells are a key therapeutic target in hypertension and are the preferred molecular target of the initial calcium channel antagonists. However, third-generation dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel antagonists, including manidipine, nilvadipine, benidipine and efonidipine, appear to have effects in addition to blockade of the L-type calcium channel. Voltage-gated calcium channels are widely expressed throughout the cardiovascular system. They constitute the main route for calcium entry, essential for the maintenance of contraction. Cardiac and vascular cells predominantly express L-type calcium channels. More recently, T-type channels have been discovered, and there is emerging evidence of their significance in the regulation of arterial resistance. A lack of functional expression of L-type channels in renal efferent arterioles may be consistent with an important role of T-type channels in the regulation of efferent arteriolar tone. Although the exact role of T-type calcium channels in vascular beds remains to be determined, they could be associated with gene-activated cell replication and growth during pathology. The three major classes of calcium channel antagonists are chemically distinct, and exhibit different functional effects depending on their biophysical, conformation-dependent interactions with the L-type calcium channel. The DHPs are more potent vasodilators, and generally have less cardiodepressant activity than representatives of other classes of calcium channel antagonist such as diltiazem (a phenylalkylamine) and verapamil (a benzothiazepine). In contrast to older calcium channel antagonists, the newer DHPs, manidipine, nilvadipine, benidipine and efonidipine, dilate not only afferent but also efferent renal arterioles, a potentially beneficial effect that may improve glomerular hypertension and provide renoprotection. The underlying mechanisms for the heterogenous effects of calcium channel antagonists in the renal microvasculature are unclear. A credible hypothesis suggests a contribution of T-type calcium channels to efferent arteriolar tone, and that manidipine, nilvadipine and efonidipine inhibit both L and T-type channels. However, other mechanisms, including an effect on neuronal P/Q-type calcium channels (recently detected in arterioles), the microheterogeneity of vascular beds, and other types of calcium influx may also play a role. This article presents recent data about the expression and physiological role of calcium channels in arteries and the molecular targets of the calcium channel antagonists, particularly those exhibiting distinct renovascular effects."}

The cytotoxic interaction between EGFR inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib) and DNA cross-linking agents (e.g. platinum derivatives) might represent a promising combination for the treatment of triple-negative/basal-like breast tumors that are dependent upon EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling. We evaluated the growth and molecular interactions of the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (erbitux) and the DNA cross-linking agent cisplatin (cis-diammedichloroplatinum; CDDP) in the gefitinib-resistant MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line, an in vitro model system that shows many of the recurrent basal-like molecular abnormalities including ER-PR-HER2-negative status, TP53 deficiency, EGFR overexpression, PTEN loss and constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Unlike other basal-like breast cancer models, MDA-MB-468 cells do not carry mutations of the key DNA repair gene BRCA1. Concurrent treatment with sub-optimal doses of cetuximab significantly enhanced CDDP-induced apoptotic cell death. However, an isobologram-based mathematical assessment of the nature of the interaction revealed a loss of synergism when employing a high-dose of cetuximab. Since BRCA1 depletion has been found to decrease DNA damage repair and cell survival in MDA-MB-468 cells when treated with DNA-damaging drugs, we employed ELISA-based quantitative analyses to measure BRCA1 protein levels in CDDP+/- cetuximab-treated cells. Cetuximab as single agent was as efficient as CDDP at increasing BRCA1 protein expression. Interestingly, cetuximab co-exposure significantly antagonized the ability of CDDP to up-regulate BRCA1 expression. Low-scale phosphor-proteomic approaches [i.e. phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) Array Proteome Profiler capable of simultaneously identifying the relative levels of phosphorylation of 42 different RTKs and 23 different MAPKs and other serine/threonine kinases, respectively] revealed the ability of Cetuximab, as single agent, to paradoxically induce hyper-phosphorylation of EGFR while concomitantly deactivating p42/44 (ERK1/ERK2) MAPK. Unexpectedly, ELISA-based quantitative analyses of EGFR protein content demonstrated that simultaneous exposure to cetuximab and optimal doses of CDDP completely depleted EGFR protein in MDA-MB-468 cells. Although these findings preclinically support, at least in part, ongoing clinical trials for 'triple-negative/basal-like' metastatic breast cancer patients who are receiving either cetuximab alone versus cetuximab plus carboplatin (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00232505), the unexpected ability of CDDP to promote a complete depletion of the cetuximab target EGFR further suggests that treatment schedules, cetuximab/CDDP doses and BRCA1 status should be carefully considered when combining anti-EGFR antibodies and platinum derivatives in triple-negative/basal-like breast carcinomas."}

Consequently, it is difficult for most physicians to develop a familiarity with all the different hypertensive crises and with all drugs available for treating them (Table 4). Clinicians should not agonize over which is the perfect therapeutic agent for a particular emergency, but instead, they should focus on scrupulous monitoring and familiarize themselves with a few agents that will serve in most situations. Generally, these agents will be sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin. Vigilant neurologic monitoring is mandatory in all hypertensive emergencies. The early symptoms and signs of cerebral hypoperfusion can be vague and subtle, but if recognized, serious complications of therapy can be avoided. Remember, the patient may still be hypertensive. Avoid acute (during the first hour) reductions in MAP of more than 20% whenever possible; subsequent reductions should be gradual. In patients known to have markedly elevated ICP and who need acute reductions in their BP, serious consideration should be given to direct monitoring of the ICP so that CPP can be maintained within safe limits. In general, oral agents should not be used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Intravenous Labetalol and intravenous nicardipine are not suitable for general use in hypertensive emergencies. In special situations (e.g., perioperative hypertension and subarachnoid hemorrhage), however, they may be employed. Their role may expand with further study. Trimethaphan may be superior to nitroprusside for hypertension complicated by elevated ICP or cerebral dysfunction. Realistically, most physicians will continue to use nitroprusside. Intense neurologic monitoring is more important than the specific agent used. Nitroglycerin is the agent of choice for acute ischemic heart disease complicated by severe hypertension; if it fails, use nitroprusside. For aortic dissection, the combination of nitroprusside and IV propranolol is the therapy of choice; beta-blockade must be achieved rapidly or the dissection may worsen. Trimethaphan is also an agent for first-line therapy. Esmolol is an alternative to IV propranolol for the treatment of aortic dissection, if prolonged beta-blockade might seriously jeopardize the patient. For eclampsia, unless an expert in hypertension during pregnancy has established an alternative, the therapy of choice is hydralazine and magnesium. The treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage is in flux; calcium channel blockers are used to prevent spasm, not to lower BP. If the BP must be lowered immediately, use nitroprusside."}

These IVIg non-responders are at high risk for coronary artery lesions (CAL), and may need alternative or supplemental therapy. Based on retrospective studies (albeit with low evidence levels), glucocorticoid therapy was hitherto thought to worsen CAL. However, subsequent prospective studies have shown that prednisolone or IV methylprednisolone pulse as the initial or rescue therapy is effective in reducing CAL. A clinical trial known as the Randomized controlled trial to Assess Immunoglobulin plus Steroid Efficacy for KD (RAISE) Study, demonstrated the efficacy of prednisolone with initial IVIg, especially in predicted IVIg non-responders. Several meta-analyses have also supported the use of glucocorticoids for patients with severe forms of KD. Glucocorticoids can be considered as pre-emptive therapy for children with severe KD and as rescue therapy for initial non-responders. However, routine use of glucocorticoids in KD remains a contentious issue and would need further study."}

At the end of the experiment, tissue samples obtained from the cardiac muscle of the left ventricle of the rats were processed for measurement of malondialdehyde and for electron microscopic examination. Malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation, was found to be significantly higher in the doxorubicin group. However, in the doxorubicin and melatonin combination group the level of malondialdehyde was decreased statistical significant. The histological examination revealed destruction of myofibrils, disorganization of sarcomeres, mitochondrial degeneration and formation of giant mitochondria and lipid accumulation in the doxorubicin group. Also, accumulation of filamentous structures in the sarcoplasma in some of the cells, structural changes in capillaries and an increase in collagen fibers forming bundles were observed. When melatonin was added to the doxorubicin treatment all structural changes were reduced. The cardiotoxic side effect of doxorubicin used as a chemotherapeutic agent and was probably developed as a result of suppression of the antioxidant system and lipid peroxidation. Therefore, it could be assumed that the addition of melatonin in the treatment of doxorubicin could prevent the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin."}

The addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy roughly doubles the proportion of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who achieve pathological complete response (pCR). Patients with pCR show better prognosis compared with those with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. Targeting the HER2 pathway with trastuzumab and pertuzumab can further increase the pCR rate. Several studies have shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab is tolerable, increases the pCR rate compared with trastuzumab alone, and results in about 50-70% pCR rate. One of the most important studies on neoadjuvant therapy is the KATHERINE trial, in which improved prognostic outcome for patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy was observed. In the trial, improved invasive disease-free survival (DFS) was observed with the administration of postoperative trastuzumab emtansine in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who had residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. The indication of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer may be changed because the opportunity for residual disease-guided approach, demonstrated in the KATHERINE trial, will be lost when patients had first undergone surgery. Translational studies are promising for further patient selection for HER2-targeted therapy and the development of a novel treatment strategy including PI3K-targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Feasibility studies to evaluate the ability of needle-biopsy to predict pCR after neoadjuvant therapy suggested that standardization and refinements in biopsy procedure (i.e., needle size, number of samples, etc.) are essential for the design of clinical trials of omitted surgery for patients with radiologic complete response."}

In cats anaesthetized with chloralose the release of vasopressin in response to nicotine injections was examined. This release was measured by assaying the hormone in samples of venous blood. 2. Nicotine injections were given by three different routes, namely intravertebral, intracarotid and intravenous. The first two represent close arterial routes to the medulla and to the hypothalamus, respectively, the effects of which could be compared to those following intravenous, i.e. systemic, administration. 3. Nicotine was found to increase vasopressin secretion by all three routes of administration. The potency of intracarotid injections was found to be no greater than that of intravenous injections, in sharp contrast to intravertebral injections, which were 4-5 times more potent. 4. In terms of vascular effects, intracarotid and intravenous injections of nicotine were found to increase blood pressure, whereas intravertebral injections of low doses of nicotine were always followed by a fall in blood pressure. Higher doses of intravertebral nicotine produce mixed results, pressor or depressor, in different animals. 5. The vasodepressor effect of intravertebral nicotine was part of a cardiovascular response which included a lowering of total peripheral resistance and of stroke work, whereas the cardiac output, the heart rate and the stroke volume remained essentially unchanged. 6. These results clearly indicate that a medullary area, which has been previously described, is the most sensitive site for the vasopressin releasing action of nicotine and that systemic administration of the drug induces vasopressin secretion by virtue of its action on the medulla, rather than directly on the supraoptic nucleus. 7. The results also indicate that the vasodepressor effect which follows the application of nicotine on the medulla is chiefly due to vasodilator effects on systemic blood vessels, with practically no action on cardiac function. The significance of these results is discussed."}

Runoff in aqueous and sediment phases was collected every 5 min for 1h with varied rainfall intensity and additional surface (0-2 cm) and depth (2-30 cm) soil samples were collected after rainfall simulation for mass balance analysis. Quantification of antibiotic concentration in all collected samples was based on solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by measurement with high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS). MNS showed the highest concentration in runoff aqueous samples (0.22 mg plot(-1)), while ETM showed the highest concentration in runoff sediment samples (0.08 mg plot(-1)). The highest concentration of each applied antibiotic in surface soil samples occurred at different locations. This result might indicate the mobility of these compounds in surface soil varies due to different physicochemical properties among the antibiotics. Further, the analysis results showed that all of the subject antibiotics had penetrated into the subsurface; yet, no residuals were found for STZ, suggesting this compound might have penetrated even deeper into the soil. These results indicate that aqueous or sediment erosion control might reduce the transport of veterinary antibiotics in the environment."}

All patients are evaluable for overall and progression-free survival with a median follow-up of 70 months (range: 3-162 months); 39 patients are evaluable for response. All complete responses were surgically confirmed. The median age was 59 (range 28-82 years); 3 patients were stage IC, 5 were IIC, 14 patients were stage III (optimally debulked), 14 patients were stage III (suboptimally debulked), and 7 patients were stage IV. Two patients had received prior alkylator therapy. Six of 8 patients with Stage IC or II remain without evidence of disease at a mean of 12 years following chemotherapy. Of 14 optimally debulked stage III patients, there were 7 complete responses, 3 partial responses, 1 patient with stable disease, and 3 inevaluable patients. Of 14 suboptimally debulked stage III patients there were 4 complete responses, 4 partial responses, 3 with stable disease, 2 progressions on treatment, and 1 inevaluable patient. Five-year progression-free and overall survivals for stage III optimally debulked patients are 21 and 64%, respectively. At 10 years, progression-free and overall survivals for this group are 21 and 29%, respectively. Toxicity included neutropenia (complicated by sepsis in 2 patients), infrequent thrombocytopenia, and mild anemia.

Comparison of human CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of CTLA4-Ig showed that co-stimulation blockade during TCR activation does not affect NFAT signaling but results in decreased activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors followed by a profound decrease in proliferation and cytokine production. The resulting T cells become hyporesponsive to secondary activation and, although capable of receiving TCR signals, fail to proliferate or produce cytokines, demonstrating properties of anergic cells. However, unlike some models of T cell anergy, these cells did not possess increased levels of the TCR signaling inhibitor CBLB. Rather, the CTLA4-Ig-induced hyporesponsiveness was associated with an elevated level of p27kip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. "}

The average follow-up for all the trials was 14.5 +/- 5.6 months. On the whole in patients on beta-blocker treatment there is a 33.3% reduction in total mortality rate, a 34.2% reduction in cardiac death rate, a 37.7% reduction in sudden death rate, and a 41.7% reduction in worsening heart failure mortality rate. Moreover, in beta-blocker patients there is a 31.7% reduction in all-cause readmissions to hospital and a 26% reduction in the combined end point (total mortality and hospital readmission). Beta-blockers improved ventricular function but there was no significant improvement in functional capacity. In conclusion, the results of the six trials considered indicate that there is convincing evidence supporting a favorable effect of beta-blockade on the risk of death and readmission to hospital in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction, aged < 70 years, in NYHA functional class II-III.

Dose escalation was permitted only after full toxicity assessment had been completed for two cycles for all patients at a dose level. Dose escalation of paclitaxel continued to 225 mg/m2 without dose-limiting toxicity, but further escalation was not attempted because of the known likelihood of neurotoxicity above this dosage.

At these doses, dose-limiting myelosuppression was not seen, and there was only one episode of febrile neutropenia in 162 treatment cycles. Drug-related ifosfamide toxicities included gross hematuria and confusion in one patient each; paclitaxel-related symptoms included flu-like syndrome in most patients, arthralgia and/or myalgia in eight and 25 patients, respectively, and paresthesia in 14 patients.

The mechanism of action of these cell cycle-dependent agents is the inhibition of tubulin polymerisation into microtubules. Numerous studies have been conducted in animals and humans, using various in vivo and in vitro models, to investigate the pharmacological behaviour of this class of antitumour drug. Studies in cellular pharmacology demonstrate that vinca alkaloids are transported by multiple mechanisms, including passive diffusion and energy- and temperature-dependent active transport systems. Moreover, active efflux of drug is involved in the P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance to vinca alkaloids. This phenomenon may be modulated, in vivo and in vitro, by calcium antagonists and calmodulin inhibitors. The clinical pharmacokinetics of vinca alkaloids after intravenous bolus injection, continuous infusion and oral administration are characterised by a large apparent total volume of distribution, high total plasma clearance and long terminal elimination half-life. Biliary excretion is the main elimination pathway, with low urinary excretion. Pharmacokinetic parameters of vinca alkaloids are time- and dose-dependent, and large inter- and intra-individual variabilities have been observed. Human hepatic P-450IIIA cytochromes are involved in the metabolism of vindesine, vinblastine and probably other vinca alkaloids. Therefore, the possibility of drug-drug interactions must be considered when coadministering drugs in combination cancer chemotherapy. Development of newer semisynthetic analogues of vinca alkaloids and conjugation of vinca alkaloids with monoclonal antibodies may result in derivatives with increased antitumour activity and less clinical toxicity."}

Keeping in mind the low diffusivity and availability of cell surface targets on cancer cells, we designed a targeted system to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to the bone microenvironment as an approach to tissue targeting using alendronate (Aln). We co-encapsulated curcumin and bortezomib in the PLGA nanoparticles to further enhance the therapeutic efficiency and overall clinical outcome.

The particles were spherical with smooth surface and had particle size of 235 \u00b1 70.30 nm. We validated the bone targeting ability of these nanoparticles in vitro. Curcumin and bortezomib are known to have synergistic effect in inhibition of growth of cancer; however there was no synergism in the anti-osteoclastogenic activity of these agents. Surprisingly, curcumin by itself had significant inhibition of osteclastogenic activity. In vivo non-invasive bioimaging showed higher localization of Aln-coated nanoparticles to the bone compared to control groups, which was further confirmed by histological analysis. Aln-coated nanoparticles protected bone resorption and decreased the rate of tumor growth as compared to control groups in an intraosseous model of bone metastasis. Our data show efficient attachment of Aln on the surface of nanoparticles which could be used as a drug carrier for preferential delivery of multiple therapeutic agents to bone microenvironment."}

These bioenhancers must also be implied to enhance the bioavailability and bioefficacy through routes other than the oral route of drug delivery. There is a vast array of unexploited plants which can be investigated for their drug bioenhancing potency. The toxicity profiles of these herbal bioenhancers must not be overlooked.

Pharmacokinetic interactions involve changes in absorption, distribution or elimination, whereas pharmacodynamic interactions involve synergism and antagonism at the site of action.

Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and primidone are strong inducers of cytochrome P450 and glucuronizing enzymes (as well as P-glycoprotein) and can reduce the efficacy of co-administered medications such as oral anticoagulants, calcium antagonists, steroids, antimicrobial and antineoplastic drugs through this mechanism.

Unlike enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition results in decreased metabolic clearance of the affected drug, the serum concentration of which may increase leading to toxic effects. Examples of important interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition include the increase in the serum concentration of phenobarbital and lamotrigine caused by valproic acid. There are also interactions whereby other drugs induce or inhibit the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs, examples being the increase in serum carbamazepine concentration by erythromycin, and the decrease in serum lamotrigine concentration by oestrogen-containing contraceptives. Pharmacodynamic interactions between antiepileptic drugs may also be clinically important.

Bortezomib combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with advanced tumors, predominantly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), showed an unexpected transient drop in the deoxycytidine plasma levels, a marker for gemcitabine activity. This study investigates the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic effect of bortezomib on gemcitabine in NSCLC and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Gemcitabine metabolites, including difluoro-dCTP (dFdCTP), were studied in PBMCs from bortezomib/gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated patients and from volunteers and NSCLC cells (H460 and SW1573) exposed to 4 h simultaneous or sequential treatments of gemcitabine (50 \u03bcmol/L, 4 h) and bortezomib (100 nmol/L, 2 h). Gemcitabine total phosphate levels measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in PBMCs from bortezomib/gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated patients were strongly reduced after 90 min (-82.2%) up to 4 h post-gemcitabine infusion compared with gemcitabine/cisplatin-treated patients. Accordingly, bortezomib/gemcitabine combinations reduced dFdCTP in PBMCs treated ex vivo. Surprisingly, differential effects were observed in NSCLC cells. dFdCTP decreased after 4 h following gemcitabine removal in H460 but continued to increase for 24 h in SW1573. However, dFdCTP significantly increased (2-fold) in both cell lines in the bortezomib \u2192 gemcitabine exposure, coinciding with a major reduction in cell growth compared with single drugs, and the highest increase of deoxycytidine kinase expression, possibly mediated via E2F-1. Bortezomib affects differently gemcitabine pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in PBMCs and NSCLC cells, suggesting that PBMCs are not adequate to evaluate the anticancer activity of bortezomib/gemcitabine combinations. The bortezomib \u2192 gemcitabine/cisplatin schedule appeared a safe and active combination for the treatment of advanced NSCLC and the bortezomib \u2192 gemcitabine was the most cytotoxic combination in NSCLC cells.

Our previous work has shown that these favorable outcomes are linked to the cytoplasmic relocalization and inactivation of FOXM1 driven by mutated NPM1. Here, we went on to confirm the important role of FOXM1 in increased chemoresistance in AML. A multiinstitution retrospective study was conducted to link FOXM1 expression to clinical outcomes in AML. We establish nuclear FOXM1 as an independent clinical predictor of chemotherapeutic resistance in intermediate-risk AML in a multivariate analysis incorporating standard clinicopathologic risk factors. Using colony assays, we show a dramatic decrease in colony size and numbers in AML cell lines with knockdown of FOXM1, suggesting an important role for FOXM1 in the clonogenic activity of AML cells. In order to further prove a potential role for FOXM1 in AML chemoresistance, we induced an FLT3-ITD-driven myeloid neoplasm in a FOXM1-overexpressing transgenic mouse model and demonstrated significantly higher residual disease after standard chemotherapy. This suggests that constitutive overexpression of FOXM1 in this model induces chemoresistance. Finally, we performed proof-of-principle experiments using a currently approved proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, to target FOXM1 and demonstrated a therapeutic response in AML patient samples and animal models of AML that correlates with the suppression of FOXM1 and its transcriptional targets. Addition of low doses of ixazomib increases sensitization of AML cells to chemotherapy backbone drugs cytarabine and the hypomethylator 5-azacitidine. Our results underscore the importance of FOXM1 in AML progression and treatment, and they suggest that targeting it may have therapeutic benefit in combination with standard AML therapies."}

In contrast, activation of groups II or III mGluRs by DCG-IV or l-AP4, respectively, failed to evoke any significant change in [Ca(2+)](i). The effect of (S)-3,5-DHPG was mediated by both group I subtypes mGluR1 and mGluR5, since combined pre-treatment with the subtype antagonists (S)-4-CPG and MPEP was necessary to abolish the [Ca(2+)](i) increase. Depleting intracellular Ca(2+) stores with CPA or inhibiting IP(3)-receptors with 2-APB, respectively, reduced the (S)-3,5-DHPG-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) increase significantly. Inhibition of voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs) by verapamil or nicardipine reduced the (S)-3,5-DHPG-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise likewise. Thus, in rat spinal cord, (S)-3,5-DHPG enhances Ca(2+) signalling in superficial dorsal horn neurons, mediated by the release of Ca(2+) from IP(3)-sensitive intracellular stores and by an influx through L-type VDCCs.

The increases in [Ca2+]i elicited by the three ETs (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3) were transient and did not show a sustained phase. Chelating extracellular Ca2+ in the medium by adding excess EGTA decreased the ET-mediated Ca2+ response by 40-50%. This result indicates that a substantial portion of the increase in [Ca2+]i was due to influx from an extracellular source. However, the increase in [Ca2+]i was not affected by verapamil or nifedipine (10(-5) M). A rank order potency of ET-1 > ET-2 > ET-3 is shown for the stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i, as well as labeled inositol phosphates, in these cells. ATP (10(-4) M) and bradykinin (10(-7) M) also induced the increases in [Ca2+]i and Ins(1,4,5)P3 in NG108-15 cells, albeit to a different extent. When compared at 10(-7) M, bradykinin elicited a five- to sixfold higher increase in the level of Ins(1,4,5)P3, but less than a twofold higher increase in [Ca2+]i than those induced by ET-1. Additive increases in both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [Ca2+]i were observed when ET-1, ATP, and bradykinin were added to the cells in different combinations, suggesting that each receptor agonist is responsible for the hydrolysis of a pool of polyphosphoinositide within the membrane. ET-1 exhibited homologous desensitization of the Ca2+ response, but partial heterologous desensitization to the Ca2+ response elicited by ATP. On the contrary, ET-1 did not desensitize the response elicited by bradykinin, although bradykinin exhibited complete heterologous desensitization to the response elicited by ET-1. Taken together, these results illustrate that, in NG108-15 cells, a considerable amount of receptor cross talk occurs between ET and other receptors that transmit signals through the polyphosphoinositide pathway."}

Amylase release stimulated by histamine was inhibited by pyrilamine, an H1-receptor blocker, but not by cimetidine, an H2-receptor blocker. Atropine, prazosin and yohimbine had no effect on the release. Histamine-stimulated amylase release was inhibited by W-7, ML-9 and H-7, inhibitors of a calmodulin, a myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and protein kinase C, respectively, while H-8, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, did not inhibit the release. These results suggest that histamine stimulation evokes amylase release via H1-receptors, followed by the Ca2+-dependent systems involving calmodulin, MLCK and protein kinase C."}

Previously we demonstrated that bradykinin infusion could increase glucose uptake into dog peripheral tissues, and that bradykinin could potentiate insulin-induced glucose uptake through glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation in dog adipocytes. However, skeletal muscle is the predominant tissue for insulin-mediated glucose disposal. The aim of this study was to determine how bradykinin affected insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in dog skeletal muscle and myotubes transformed from rat L6 myoblasts. The bradykinin receptor binding studies revealed that dog skeletal muscle and rat L6 myoblasts possessed significant numbers of bradykinin receptors (Kd = 88 and 76 pmol/l, Bmax = 82.5 and 20 fmol/mg protein respectively). An RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) amplification showed mRNA specific for bradykinin B2 receptor in both cells. Bradykinin significantly increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated muscle and L6 myoblasts in the presence of insulin (10(-7) mol/l) in a dose-dependent manner, but not in the absence of insulin. Bradykinin also enhanced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta subunit and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) without affecting the binding affinities or numbers of cell surface insulin receptors in both cells. It is concluded that bradykinin could potentiate the insulin-induced glucose uptake through GLUT4 translocation in dog skeletal muscle and rat L6 myoblasts. This effect could be explained by the potency of bradykinin to upregulate the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity which stimulates phosphorylation of IRS-1, followed by an increase in GLUT4 translocation."}

Mafosfamide, the active form of cyclophosphamide in vitro, increased the cytotoxicity of fludarabine in all of the patients studied and produced a significant synergistic effect (P <.01) after 48 hours of incubation. The addition of mitoxantrone to this combination increased the cytotoxic effect in cells from 8 patients, but in the remaining 12 patients no significant increase was observed. The effect of fludarabine and mafosfamide was dose-dependent. Mafosfamide and fludarabine had a synergistic effect in inducing apoptosis of B-CLL cells as determined by DNA staining with propidium iodide and analysis of phosphatidylserine exposure. Mafosfamide significantly increased the apoptosis induced by fludarabine on CD19(+) cells (P =.007), but not on CD3(+) cells (P =. 314).

The cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, flow cytometry, and wound-healing and transwell migration assays were used to detect cell viability, clonogenic survival, cell cycle and cell migration, respectively. RT-PCR and western blot analyses were used to determine the mRNA and protein levels of related molecules. Results showed that combination treatment with liraglutide (100 nmol/L) and metformin (0.75 mmol/L) significantly decreased cell viability and colony formation, caused cell cycle arrest, upregulated the level of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and inhibited cell migration in the cells, although their single treatment did not exhibit such effects. Combination index value for cell viability indicated a synergistic interaction of liraglutide and metformin. Moreover, the combined treatment with liraglutide and metformin could activate the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) more potently than their single treatment in the cells. These results suggest that liraglutide in combination with metformin has a synergistic anti-tumor effect on the pancreatic cancer cells, which may be at least partly due to activation of AMPK signaling.

Combination chemotherapy trials incorporating gemcitabine, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan generally show improved outcomes in objective response rates but with little or no improvement in survival in phase III trials. In this article, the author describes the key studies presented at the Annual Meeting of ASCO, held in Atlanta, GA from June 2nd to 6th. The studies discussed here include the following: RTOG 9704 (#4007), FFCD-SFRO study (#4008), meta-analysis of gemcitabine plus cisplatin and gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin vs. gemcitabine alone (GERCOR #4003), and ECOG 6201 (Late Breaking Abstract #4004). Based on the results presented at the annual meeting, it comes to us that patients with locally advanced vs. metastatic pancreatic cancer should be studied separately, better understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer is mandatory and evaluation of novel agents is crucial. We as oncologist have to change our attitudes towards clinical trials and need to think beyond a trial design such as gemcitabine vs. drug of our choice. Environment within which research is being conducted also has to be changed and last but not the least, access to trials for patients with pancreatic cancer is the key step in the fight against pancreatic cancer."}

Here, we identify a novel synthetic lethal interaction between the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) SAHA and anticancer drugs in RMS cells. Importantly, SAHA significantly increases chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in both embryonal and alveolar RMS cell lines, including several anticancer agents that are used in the clinic for the treatment of RMS such as Doxorubicin, Etoposide, Vincristine and Cyclophosphamide. Calculation of combination index (CI) reveals that the interaction of SAHA and Doxorubicin or Etoposide is synergistic. Mechanistically, SAHA causes acetylation of histone H3 protein in RMS cells, indicating that SAHA alters the chromatin context. Also, cotreatment with SAHA and Doxorubicin changes the ratio of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins with downregulation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of BimEL, thus shifting the balance towards apoptosis. Consistently, SAHA and Doxorubicin cooperate to stimulate activation of Bax and Bak, caspase activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly rescues SAHA/Doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis, underscoring the requirement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway for the synergistic induction of apoptosis by SAHA and Doxorubicin. Caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death is confirmed by the use of the broad-range caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk), which significantly decreases SAHA/Doxorubicin-triggered apoptosis. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the HDACI SAHA represents a promising strategy to prime RMS cells for chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and warrants further investigation in combination regimens."}

Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered as the only curative option in adults with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but relapse remains the main cause of treatment failure. Moreover, long-term survival rates are markedly decreased when transplanted patients are not in complete remission. Incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors into transplantation strategy in patients with Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia may improve prognosis of the disease. Imatinib combined with conventional chemotherapy and used in conjunction with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has improved long-term survival rates. The more potent multikinase inhibitor dasatinib has shown enhanced activity in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and has been approved for the treatment of adults with resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy. Here, we present a case of Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia primary resistant to imatinib combined with chemotherapy. Subsequently, the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a salvage therapy. Clinical evaluation performed thereafter revealed complete hematologic remission, but with the presence of the minimal residual disease detected at molecular level. Due to imatinib resistance, the therapy with dasatinib was started and complete molecular response was obtained. The consecutive clinical evaluation performed every 3\u00a0months during the last 18\u00a0months confirmed the absence of molecular minimal residual disease. We believe that inclusion of dasatinib into transplantation strategy allows obtaining sustained molecular remission even in patients resistant to imatinib."}

Its management, at least in younger patients, traditionally involves salvage chemotherapy aiming to achieve disease remission followed by consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allogeneic HCT) in eligible patients. The efficacy of salvage therapy is variable and newer combination chemotherapy regimens have improved the outcomes. Factors such as shorter time to relapse after autologous HCT and poor performance status have been identified as predictors of poor outcome. Newer agents such as immunoconjugate brentuximab vedotin, checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab), lenalidomide, and everolimus are available for the treatment of patients relapsing after autologous HCT. With the availability of reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT, more patients are eligible for this therapy with lesser toxicity and better efficacy due to graft versus lymphoma effects. Alternative donor sources such as haploidentical stem cell transplantation and umbilical cord blood transplantation are expanding this procedure to patients without HLA-matched donors. However, strategies aimed at reduction of disease relapse after reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT are needed to improve the outcomes of this treatment. This review summarizes the current data on salvage chemotherapy and HCT strategies used to treat patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma after prior autologous HCT."}

Although glutamate is co-localized with SP in dorsal root ganglion neurons, its role in nociceptive processing is uncertain. While antagonists of NKs and excitatory amino acids (EAAs) have been found to be antinociceptive in some acute assays, they have not been tested against tonic pain. We hypothesize that: (1) NKs and EAAs contribute to signaling of tonic chemogenic nociception; and (2) interaction between NK and EAA systems is important in determining the perceived intensity of a continuous noxious stimulus. We therefore evaluated two NK antagonists ([D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9] SP (DPDT-SP, 0.26-6.6 nmoles, non-specific) and [D-Pro4, D-Trp7,9,10,Phe11]-SP(4-11) (DPDTP-octa, 1.6-12.3 nmoles, somewhat NK-1 selective], as well as DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-AP5, NMDA antagonist, 0.05-1 nmole) and urethane (a kainic acid (KA) antagonist at 2.5 mumoles) for antinociceptive activity in the mouse formalin model.

We retrospectively examined 29 immunocompetent patients with PCNSL who underwent SWI-MRI before treatment. A univariate analysis was conducted with Fisher's exact test. Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log rank test. The patients, including 16 males, were initially treated at a median age of 69\u202fyears. All tissue types were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Nineteen patients (66%) presented lesions with ITSS. Sixteen patients (55%) received initial treatment with R-MTX (rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate). Seven out of nine patients with ITSS exhibited a poor response, whereas all seven without ITSS exhibited a good response to R-MTX. Regarding the absence of ITSS, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for a good response to R-MTX were 0.78, 1.00, and 0.88, respectively. Patients without ITSS showed significantly longer PFS compared to patients with ITSS (median PFS: 28.9 vs 2.1\u202fmonths, P\u202f<\u202f0.01). In conclusion, ITSS in PCNSL patients were more common than previously reported. We have to be careful to use ITSS for differentiating PCNSL and glioblastoma. Presence of ITSS correlated significantly with therapeutic response to R-MTX. ITSS may be a new marker for the response to chemotherapy in patients with PCNSL.

At present, there are five licenced disease-modifying agents in MS - interferon-beta1b, interferon-beta1a, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab and mitoxantrone. All have shown significant therapeutic efficacy in large controlled trials. However, current therapies are only partially effective and are not free from adverse effects. Moreover, available DMTs are overwhelmingly biased in favour of those with relapsing-remitting disease. Effective treatment for progressive MS is severely limited, with only interferon-beta1b and mitoxantrone having licenced use in secondary progressive, but not primary progressive disease. Monoclonal antibodies, such as natalizumab selectively target immune pathways involved in the pathogenic process of MS. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and rituximab are other notable monoclonal antibodies currently undergoing phase II and III trials in MS. Alemtuzumab has so far shown promising therapeutic benefit in relapsing disease, although immunological adverse effects have been a problem. Oral therapies have the benefit of improved tolerability and patient compliance compared with current parenteral treatments. Cladribine and fingolimod (FTY720) have shown encouraging results in their phase III clinical trials. It is also worth noting the evidence for starting DMT in patients with clinically isolated syndrome, whereby early treatment has shown to delay the onset of clinically definite MS in separate phase III studies."}

NSCLC has been the first epithelial neoplasm treated with a targeted first-line therapy in patients harbouring EGFR activating mutations or ALK rearrangements, and new targeted-based agents directed versus other molecular alterations are currently in development. The recognition of the importance of histology for the definition of a first-line therapy of WT tumors has led to the adoption of different regimens for patients with squamous and non-squamous histology. In particular, in case of WT NSCLC with non-squamous histology, the use of platinum-based combinations including pemetrexed or bevacizumab became the standard treatment and the maintenance therapy with pemetrexed a further opportunity for selected patients. Recently, new active drugs with different mechanisms of action, including angiogenesis inhibitors, such as nintedanib or ramucirumab, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, have shown relevant overall survival improvement in pretreated patients, modifying the landscape also of the second line treatment that became more rich and complex. The improvement and the application of novel technologies of molecular analysis and the identification of predictive biomarkers for new agents and in particular for immunotherapy will allow a more comprehensive molecular profiling of NSCLC and a better customization of treatments."}

We describe the results of a prospective, multicenter trial using sirolimus + tacrolimus as immunoprophylaxis, and compare this approach with our previous experience using cyclosporine + mycophenolate in the setting of unrelated donor transplantation setting after reduced-intensity conditioning. Forty-five patients received cyclosporine + mycophenolate between 2002 and mid-2007, while the subsequent 50 patients, who were transplanted from late 2007, were given sirolimus + tacrolimus. No significant differences were observed in terms of hematopoietic recovery or acute graft-versus-host disease overall, although gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease grade \u2265 2 was more common in the cyclosporine + mycophenolate group (55% versus 21%, respectively, P=0.003).

Clinical studies have been mixed but there have been no studies specifically examining the effects of combining the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine with the 5HT(1A) receptor partial agonist, buspirone on monoamine release. This is of interest given previous evidence that monoamine release can alter cognition in schizophrenia. In the present study we measured in vivo levels of monoamines in the frontal cortex of Sprague Dawley rats and examined if buspirone (2.5\u2009mg/kg i.p.), altered monoamine release both when given alone and when combined with quetiapine (10\u2009mg/kg i.p.). We found that serotonin levels were not altered by either drug, either alone or in combination. In contrast, both buspirone and quetiapine monotherapy significantly increased release of noradrenaline (112 and 160% respectively) and dopamine (169 and 191% respectively) compared to controls. However, there were no additional increases in in vivo monoamine release when the combination of these drugs were given. One possible explanation for these negative findings could be that the intrinsic 5HT(1A) agonist activity of quetiapine on its own is of such significance that it is not further enhanced by buspirone. These findings do not support clinical studies combining buspirone and quetiapine, if these were to be used on the basis of enhanced monoamine neurotransmission. These findings may also have implications for the atypical antipsychotic drugs in development which combine dopamine D(2) antagonism with 5HT(1A) partial agonism."}

We hypothesized that similar to cyclophosphamide, bendamustine-induced DNA damage will be inhibited by fludarabine, resulting in increased cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis and the role of the stromal microenvironment in this process, we treated CLL lymphocytes in vitro with each drug alone and in combination. Simultaneous or prior addition of fludarabine to bendamustine resulted in maximum cytotoxicity assayed by 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodine negativity, annexin positivity, and poly (adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Cytotoxicity elicited by combination of both agents was similar in these malignant B cells cultured either in suspension or on marrow stroma cells. Cell death was associated with DNA damage response, which was determined by phosphorylation of H2AX and unscheduled DNA synthesis. H2AX activation was maximum with the drug combination, and unscheduled DNA synthesis induced by bendamustine was blocked by fludarabine. In parallel, ATM, Chk2, and p53 were phosphorylated and PUMA was induced. Cell death was caspase independent; however, caspases did decrease levels of Mcl-1 survival protein.

In this study, we used a novel strategy of combining several FDA-approved targeted drugs, including sunitinib, dasatinib, and everolimus, in human ovarian cancers. Combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib with the SRC inhibitor dasatinib showed synergistic anti-tumor activity in human ovarian cancer cells. The increased activity was associated with inhibition of the STAT3, SRC, and MAPK signaling pathways, but not AKT signaling. To inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, we added the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, which further increased anti-tumor activity in cells. Combined treatment with sunitinib, dasatinib, and everolimus also resulted in greater inhibition of human ovarian tumor growth in mice. Furthermore, the triple combination also synergistically increased the anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of several signaling pathways results in better anti-tumor activity compared to inhibiting any of these signaling pathways alone."}

After 75 days of treatment, once again there was no significant difference in efficacy between the two groups: -14 mmHg for diastolic pressure and 80 per cent responders in patients treated with sustained release verapamil, -11.3 mmHg and 62.5 per cent responders in the captopril group. The percentage of responders was 58.3 per cent in the group treated with the combination of sustained release verapamil + captopril from day 45 onwards. The number of patients showing evidence of clinical or electrocardiographic adverse reactions was not significantly different: 20.7 per cent in the sustained release verapamil group and 34.8 per cent in the captopril group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Some histone deacetylases (HDACs) promote tumor cell growth and pan- or selective HDAC inhibitors are active in some cancers; however, the pivotal HDAC enzyme and its functions in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remain largely unknown. Using NanoString nCounter assays, we profiled HDAC mRNA expression and identified HDAC6 as an upregulated HDAC family member in DLBCL tissue samples. We then found that HDAC6 plays an oncogenic role in DLBCL, as evidenced by its promotion of cell proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanistically, the interaction between HDAC6 and HR23B downregulated HR23B expression, thereby reducing the levels of casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl), an E3 ubiquitin ligase for hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), which resulted in the inhibition of MET ubiquitination-dependent degradation. In addition, enhanced HDAC6 expression and decreased HR23B expression were correlated with poor overall survival rates among patients with DLBCL. Taken together, these results establish an HDAC6-HR23B-MET axis and indicate that HDAC6 is a potent promoter of lymphomagenesis in DLBCL. Thus, a therapeutic strategy based on HDAC6 inhibitors in combination with MET inhibitors is promising. Copyright \u00a9 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Stability of the conjugates in different pH was assessed, and their cytotoxicity in combination toward A2780 human ovarian cancer cells was evaluated by combination index analysis. Treatment duration (4 and 72 h) and sequence of addition were explored. In addition, an HPMA copolymer conjugate with both GEM and PTX in the side chains was evaluated in a similar manner and compared to a physical mixture of individual conjugates. Conjugates with narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn<1.1) were obtained via RAFT polymerization, and drug loadings of between 5.5 and 9.2 wt% were achieved. Conjugates demonstrated moderate stability with less than 65% release over 24h at pH 7.4, and near complete drug release in the presence of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B in 3h. In combination, the cytotoxic effects of a mixture of the conjugates were primarily additive. Synergistic effects were observed when A2780 human ovarian cancer cells were treated simultaneously for 4h with multiblock conjugates (CI<0.7). When both GEM and PTX were conjugated to the same copolymer backbone, moderate antagonism (CI 1.3-1.6) was observed.

Both total population and resistant subpopulations were quantified. Drug concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The impact of monotherapy versus that of combination therapy for attainment of a 3-log cell kill and for resistance suppression was examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Drug exposures were calculated by fitting the concentration-time data using the ADAPT II package of programs. For both isolates, monotherapy allowed resistance emergence with all but the largest exposure or with all exposures. In contrast, there was no resistance emergence with any combination regimen. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in time to attainment of a 3-log cell kill as well as time to resistance emergence for monotherapy and combination therapy for both isolates, in favor of the combination regimens. Determination of the pharmacodynamic indices associated with resistance suppression demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold reduction with the use of combinations. Combination therapy with meropenem and levofloxacin provides a significantly faster time to attain a 3-log cell kill and significantly better resistance suppression than does either monotherapy. This combination should be evaluated in a clinical trial."}

Painful diabetic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, which often makes the patients suffer from severe hyperalgesia and allodynia. Thus far, the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy remains unsatisfactory. Metformin, which is the first-line drug for type-2 diabetes, has been proved to attenuate hyperexcitability in sensory neurons linked to chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, highlighting its potential in alleviating pain related with painful diabetic neuropathy. The present study was designed to investigate the potential beneficial effect of metformin on hyperalgesia and allodynia in diabetic rats. The mechanical sensitivity, heat nociception, and cold allodynia were examined. The levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and advanced glycation end-products in the blood were measured. The expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and AMPK target genes were examined in the sciatic nerves of the animals. It was found that metformin was capable of attenuating diabetes-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, heat hyperalgesia and cold allodynia. In addition, metformin was capable of decreasing malondialdehyde and glycation end-products levels in blood, as well as increasing superoxide dismutas activity, indicating the inhibitory effect of metformin against diabetes-induced oxidative stress. Further studies showed that metformin could activate AMPK and increase the AMPK target genes in sciatic nerves in diabetic rats. In conclusion, metformin is able to attenuate diabetes-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia, which might be associated its anti-oxidative effect through AMPK pathway. Metformin might be used as an effective drug, especially with fewer side effects, for abnormal sensation in painful diabetic neuropathy. "}

However, hypoxia also leads to treatment opportunities as demonstrated by the development of compounds that target regions of hypoxia within tumors. Evofosfamide is a hypoxia-activated prodrug that is created by linking the hypoxia-seeking 2-nitroimidazole moiety to the cytotoxic bromo-isophosphoramide mustard (Br-IPM). When evofosfamide is delivered to hypoxic regions of tumors, the DNA cross-linking toxin, Br-IPM, is released leading to cell death. This study assessed the anticancer efficacy of evofosfamide in combination with the Proapoptotic Receptor Agonists (PARAs) dulanermin and drozitumab against human osteosarcoma in vitro and in an intratibial murine model of osteosarcoma. Under hypoxic conditions in vitro, evofosfamide cooperated with dulanermin and drozitumab, resulting in the potentiation of cytotoxicity to osteosarcoma cells. In contrast, under the same conditions, primary human osteoblasts were resistant to treatment. Animals transplanted with osteosarcoma cells directly into their tibiae developed mixed osteosclerotic/osteolytic bone lesions and consequently developed lung metastases 3\u00a0weeks post cancer cell transplantation. Tumor burden in the bone was reduced by evofosfamide treatment alone and in combination with drozitumab and prevented osteosarcoma-induced bone destruction while also reducing the growth of pulmonary metastases. These results suggest that evofosfamide may be an attractive therapeutic agent, with strong anticancer activity alone or in combination with either drozitumab or dulanermin against osteosarcoma."}

Here we used an animal model to assess whether oxytocin might be effective in the treatment of methamphetamine addiction. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to lever press to intravenously self-administer methamphetamine under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Once responding had stabilised, one group of rats received escalating doses of oxytocin (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally (IP) prior to daily self-administration tests, while other rats received vehicle. After these tests, lever-pressing was extinguished and the ability of methamphetamine primes (IP, 1 mg/kg) to reinstate responding was studied with and without co-administration of oxytocin (IP, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg). Results showed that oxytocin dose-dependently reduced responding for intravenous methamphetamine with an almost complete absence of responding at the highest oxytocin dose (1 mg/kg). Hyperactivity during methamphetamine self-administration was also dose-dependently reduced by oxytocin. Oxytocin (1 but not 0.3 mg/kg) also reduced the ability of methamphetamine to reinstate methamphetamine-seeking behaviour. In separate tests, oxytocin (IP, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg) robustly decreased the hyperactivity and rearing induced by methamphetamine challenge (IP, 1 mg/kg), producing activity levels similar to control animals. This study suggests that oxytocin may have a powerful inhibitory effect on the motivation to consume methamphetamine and on hyperactivity associated with acute methamphetamine intoxication. These results point to the potential utility of human trials of oxytocin as a therapeutic treatment for methamphetamine addiction."}

The altered cytokine profile and cellular component was accompanied by a decrease in HBV DNA levels in both groups, which may contribute to their therapeutic effect in CHB infection.

The investigation was primarily performed by help of agents selectively affecting the alpha-adrenoceptors: the alpha 2-agonist clonidine, the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin and the alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan. Clonidine dose-dependently stimulated the amount of ultra sonic vocalization, an effect not solely dependent upon the effect of clonidine on body temperature. In a developmental study it was found that clonidine uniformly stimulated crying at all ages from 4 days of age up to 18 days of age, that is during the whole preweaning period. Clonidine stimulated ultrasonic crying in rat pups, devoid of presynaptic catecholamine (CA) neurons by combined pretreatment with the monoamine depletor, reserpine, and the inhibitor of CA-synthesis, alpha-methyl-tyrosine. This finding suggested that the stimulating effect of clonidine on ultrasonic vocalization was mediated by postsynaptic adrenoceptors. In pups, 12 days of age, idazoxan blocked the effect of cold stimulation on ultra sonic crying, suggesting that alpha 2-adrenoceptors, presumably postsynaptic ones, mediated this kind of stimulation. Idazoxan also antagonized the effect of clonidine, but only at a dose effective also in control pups. Prazosin had no effect on cold-stimulated crying, but antagonized the effect of clonidine, suggesting that the effect of clonidine was also mediated by alpha 1-receptors. At 18 days of age, prazosin no longer antagonized the effect of clonidine, whereas the antagonizing action of idazoxan was reinforced. The age-dependent variation in responsiveness to the adrenergic drugs suggest maturational changes in the function of the CA-system occurring between 12-16 days of age."}

We show now that it is possible to pharmacologically separate the hIPSP and late depolarization from one another. In neurons intracellularly perfused for 1-2 hr with F(-) as the major anion and no ATP, the hIPSP (and the corresponding current, hIPSC) evoked by HFS was blocked, whereas neither the late depolarization nor its underlying current was attenuated. In contrast, internal perfusion with a high concentration (5 mM) of the impermeant lidocaine derivative QX-314 selectively abolished the depolarizing component of the biphasic response and also strongly reduced depolarizations evoked by extracellular microinjection of K(+). Bath application of quinine (0. 2-0.5 mM) or quinidine (0.1 mM) resulted in a pronounced inhibition of the HFS-induced extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)](o)) transient but not of the bicarbonate-dependent alkaline shift in extracellular pH. The attenuation of the [K(+)](o) transient was closely paralleled by a suppression of the HFS-evoked depolarization but not of the hIPSP. Quini(di)ne did not affect depolarizations induced by exogenous K(+) either. These data provide direct pharmacological evidence for the view that the HFS-induced biphasic response of the pyramidal neuron is composed of mechanistically distinct components: a direct GABA(A) receptor-mediated phase, which is followed by a slow, nonsynaptic [K(+)](o)-mediated depolarization. The bicarbonate-dependent, activity-induced [K(+)](o) transient can be blocked by quini(di)ne, whereas its depolarizing action in the pyramidal neuron is inhibited by internal QX-314.

Moreover, oxygen content and acid-base status were studied. In portal vein stenosed and cirrhotic rats, the addition of terlipressin (0.05 mg/kg) to propranolol (0.4 mg/kg) produced a decrease in portal pressure of 34% and 17%, respectively, and in portal tributary blood flow of 46% and 42%, respectively.

Cardiac index also further decreased after terlipressin administration. In both groups of rats, these values were similar to those observed after terlipressin alone. In portal vein stenosed rats but not in cirrhotic rats, arterial pH was significantly lower following the combination of propranolol plus terlipressin than following saline, propranolol or terlipressin alone. In conclusion, terlipressin further reduces both portal pressure and cardiac index in rats with portal hypertension receiving beta-blockers.

The intra-day precision (R.S.D.) ranged from 7.8 to 17.2% and from 9.5 to 14.1% for atenolol and cimetidine, respectively, and corresponding inter-day precisions (R.S.D.) were within 6.7-1.4% and 7.7-20.3%. The method was linear in the range 25-1500 ng/ml for atenolol (r = 0.992), and 50-3500 ng/ml for cimetidine (r = 0.976). The accuracy of the method was found to be in range 89.1-99.6% and 83.4-86% for atenolol and cimetidine, respectively. The sample clean-up obtained by carrier mediated LPME was excellent, providing a significantly lower back-ground level in total ion current chromatograms by LC-MS as compared to protein precipitation."}

The most common nonhematological toxicities possibly related to decitabine or vorinostat were infection with neutropenia (grade 3; n\u2009=\u20094) and fever/neutropenia (grade 3, n\u2009=\u20094; grade 4, n\u2009=\u20091). Of the 13 eligible patients, four achieved complete remission without platelet recovery (CRp), two partial response (PR), one stable disease (SD), one progressive disease (PD), two deaths on study and three patients who did not have end of therapy disease evaluations for an overall response rate of 46.2% (CRp\u2009+\u2009PR). Following decitabine, significant genome-wide hypo-methylation was observed. Comparison of clinical responders with nonresponders identified methylation profiles of clinical and biological relevance.

A flow microfluorimetry-based assay of nuclear DNR accumulation detected small P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated decreases in drug accumulation in a quarter of the samples. Western blotting demonstrated that topoisomerase II was present in all samples but was diminished in amount compared to the Molt3 human ALL cell line. Immunoperoxidase staining with affinity-purified antibodies revealed that topo II alpha, the target for etoposide, was detectable in only a minority of the blasts (median 7.5%, range < 1-35%) at diagnosis.

Atovaquone, a potent inhibitor of Plasmodium cytochrome bc(1), in combination with proguanil is recommended for chemoprophylaxis and treatment of malaria. The type II NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDH2) is considered an attractive drug target, as its inhibition is thought to lead to the arrest of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and, as a consequence, pyrimidine biosynthesis, an essential pathway for the parasite. Using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei as an in vivo infection model, we studied the role of NDH2 during Plasmodium life cycle progression. NDH2 can be deleted by targeted gene disruption and, thus, is dispensable for the pathogenic asexual blood stages, disproving the candidacy for an anti-malarial drug target. After transmission to the insect vector, NDH2-deficient ookinetes display an intact mitochondrial membrane potential. However, ndh2(-) parasites fail to develop into mature oocysts in the mosquito midgut. We propose that Plasmodium blood stage parasites rely on glycolysis as the main ATP generating process, whereas in the invertebrate vector, a glucose-deprived environment, the malaria parasite is dependent on an intact mitochondrial respiratory chain."}

In a previous report from our laboratory, visual assessment of wall motion in patients with coronary artery disease demonstrated no advantage for pindolol, a beta blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), over propranolol on impaired regional left ventricular (LV) function. In this study, we reanalyzed the radionuclide ventriculograms using a computer-assisted method of deriving regional ejection fraction. Use of normalized values allowed hypokinetic and normokinetic segments to be identified and examined separately. Pindolol (5-10 mg twice a day) was compared to propranolol (40-80 mg 4 times a day) in 23 patients using a randomized, crossover study design. Supine resting heart rate was reduced less (70 +/- 12 beats/min vs 63 +/- 10 beats/min, p less than 0.01) by pindolol; exercise heart rate was reduced equally by both agents. Derivation of normalized regional LV ejection fractions showed that 17 segments were hypokinetic at rest. Function of these segments increased (p less than 0.02) with pindolol. This improvement was not detected by visual assessment of regional wall motion. Thirty-seven segments were found to be hypokinetic during exercise and a significant (p less than 0.05) improvement in function occurred with pindolol and propranolol. In summary, derivation of normalized regional LV ejection fraction values allows the demonstration of significant improvement in resting LV function with pindolol, but not with propranolol in patients with regional dysfunction due to coronary artery disease. This advantage may provide a rationale for further evaluation of this agent in patients with more widespread ventricular dysfunction."}

This question led us to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli were used for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. Six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin HCl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. Drops were placed on Whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. After overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees C, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. There was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. The inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. Acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. Therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results."}

In order to employ these drugs in an individualized and precise medical manner and considering their efficacy and side effects, it seems worthwhile to learn the so far known mode of action and background history. Fumaric acid, as one of the newest drugs approved for MS, reveals the longest history as it was in use for decades as a treatment in psoriasis patients. Furthermore, fumaric acid is a good example for so far not extensively exploited option of drug reposition in medicine in general. The current review summarizes the outcomes of the clinical approval studies of fumaric acid in MS and discusses the dual mode of action, the immunomodulatory and tissue protective effect, as well as the reported adverse events under fumaric acid treatment. This review aims to serve an aid in the daily decision-making practice when choosing the baseline therapy for MS patients. "}

Felodipine and metoprolol lower BP via different, but complementary, mechanisms and controlled release formulations of these 2 drugs are available as a fixed dose combination, felodipine/metoprolol. In clinical trials in patients with hypertension, felodipine/metoprolol was significantly more effective than placebo and the respective monotherapies administered at the same dosages. Mean BP was reduced to < 155/90 mm Hg in patients treated with combination therapy and controlled in approximately 70% of patients. In one study that titrated dosages to effect, fewer felodipine/metoprolol than felodipine or metoprolol monotherapy recipients required dosage increases to achieve BP control (45 vs 60 and 67%, respectively). Data from double blind comparative studies show that the antihypertensive efficacy of felodipine/metoprolol 5 to 10/50 to 100 mg/day is significantly greater than that of enalapril monotherapy or captopril plus hydrochlorothiazide and equivalent to nifedipine/atenolol and amlodipine. In comparisons with enalapril, fewer felodipine/metoprolol than enalapril recipients required dosage titration to achieve BP control. Compared with amlodipine, felodipine/metoprolol significantly reduced mean 24-hour average BP (8.9/5.5 vs 14.4/9.5 mm Hg after 6 weeks; p < 0.001). Both treatments preserved diurnal rhythm. Long term follow-up studies show that the antihypertensive effect of felodipine/metoprolol occurs mostly during the first month of treatment with small additional decreases in BP being observed in the second and third months, and a relatively constant effect thereafter. According to a validated questionnaire, quality of life was relatively similar during 12 weeks treatment with felodipine/metoprolol, enalapril or placebo. In a retrospective pharmacoeconomic analysis conducted in Sweden, felodipine/metoprolol was more cost effective than enalapril as initial treatment for hypertension. Peripheral oedema, headache and flushing were the most commonly reported adverse events with felodipine/metoprolol and felodipine monotherapy, whereas dizziness, fatigue, headache and respiratory infection were more frequent with metoprolol monotherapy. Dose-dependent adverse events such as oedema may occur less often in patients taking lower dosages in combination than in those taking higher dosages of felodipine monotherapy. Thus, patients with hypertension treated with felodipine/metoprolol experience greater control of BP, with less need for dosage titration, than those treated with felodipine, metoprolol or enalapril monotherapy. Importantly this greater efficacy does not appear to be associated with a higher incidence of adverse events relative to monotherapy. Additionally, in short term studies felodipine/metoprolol had a similar (minimal) effect on QOL to enalapril monotherapy but was more cost effective."}

In this study, we compared all of the published growth factors (GFs), reported to promote HK migration, with HS. No single GF could duplicate the HK pro-motility activity in HS. Among these GFs, transforming growth factor-alpha [corrected] showed the highest HK pro-motility activity, reaching approximately 80% of the activity in HS.

Interestingly, the combination of TGFalpha and insulin could duplicate the HK pro-motility activity in HS, although only the TGFalpha, but not insulin, levels increase in serum over plasma. Addition of neutralizing antibodies against TGFalpha to serum or depletion of TGFalpha from serum by immunoprecipitation significantly abolished its HK pro-motility activity. Plasma with added TGFalpha stimulated HK migration that reached more than 80% of the serum stimulation. Since insulin levels are identical between plasma and serum, we propose that TGFalpha is the physiologic HK pro-motility factor in HS."}

Firstly, we constructed and analyzed the subtype-specific risk pathway crosstalk networks mediated by miRNAs. Then, we evaluated 36 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anticancer drugs by quantifying their effects on these subtype-specific pathway crosstalk networks and combining with survival analysis. Finally, some first-line treatments of breast cancer, such as Paclitaxel and Vincristine, were optimized for each subtype. In particular, we performed precision screening of subtype-specific therapeutic drugs and also confirmed some novel drugs suitable for breast cancer treatment. For example, Sorafenib was applicable for the basal subtype treatment, Irinotecan was optimum for Her2 subtype treatment, Vemurafenib was suitable for the LumA subtype treatment, and Vorinostat could apply to LumB subtype treatment. In addition, the mechanism of these optimal therapeutic drugs in each subtype of breast cancer was further dissected. In summary, our study offers an effective way to screen precision drugs for various breast cancer subtype treatments.

The magnitude of these serious outcomes from the lower GI tract is not well defined, but recent data suggest that they may be as frequent and severe as upper GI complications. Contrary to what happens in the upper GI tract, treatment and prevention of NSAID enteropathy is difficult, since the pathogenic mechanisms are different and not well understood. Among other options, misoprostol, antibiotics, and sulphasalazine have been proved to be effective in animal models, but they have not been properly tested in humans. Selective COX-2 inhibition is emerging as a potential alternative to tNSAIDs in the prevention of damage in the lower GI tract in rheumatologic patients. Preliminary studies in healthy volunteers have shown that these drugs are associated with no or less small bowel damage than tNSAIDs plus PPI, although their long-term effects in patients need to be properly tested. Post hoc analysis of previous outcome studies focused on complications of upper GI tract or cardiovascular events have shown contradictory results. Data from one ongoing trial comparing celecoxib versus diclofenac plus PPI and examining serious outcomes from the whole GI tract will probably provide new insights in this area."}

Identified genes were evaluated for influence on overall survival from OVCA using principal component analysis (PCA) modeling in an independent clinical OVCA dataset (n=218). Immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that 83% of OVCA cells and 92% of primary OVCA expressed the HGF receptor, c-Met. MK8033 exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects against a panel of human OVCA cell lines.

An indirect comparison on progression-free survival (PFS) was performed for two relevant randomised controlled trials using a well-accepted adjusted indirect comparison method. The results were used in a statistical disease model (Markov model) to extrapolate the long-term effectiveness of the two treatments. A hazard ratio of 0.83 for PFS for bevacizumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine, was calculated suggesting that this treatment is associated with a 17% lower risk of disease progression and death compared with pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment. The Markov model predicted that bevacizumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine resulted in 2.5 months additional PFS and overall survival compared with pemetrexed plus cisplatin. Based on this analysis bevacizumab plus cisplatin and gemcitabine is more effective than pemetrexed plus cisplatin for patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC and should be considered as one of the preferred targeted treatments of choice for these patients."}

Propafenone is a class IC antiarrhythmic agent that is structurally similar to the beta blockers but that has only weak beta-blocking and calcium-channel-blocking activity. It is well absorbed after oral administration, but systemic bioavailability is only 12% after a 300-mg dose. Among extensive metabolizers (greater than 90% of the United States population), bioavailability seems to vary nonlinearly with dose and increases substantially with food; these effects are not seen in poor metabolizers. Elimination is primarily hepatic, with a mean elimination half-life after oral administration of 5.5 hours in extensive metabolizers and 17.2 hours in poor metabolizers. The relationship between plasma propafenone concentration and clinical response varies considerably among individual patients; therefore, plasma concentrations have limited usefulness in predicting efficacy or electrophysiologic effects. Propafenone is effective in treating ventricular tachycardia and in suppressing premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). It is less effective in the treatment of refractory ventricular tachycardia. Concurrent administration of digoxin, warfarin, or metoprolol with propafenone has been shown to increase the serum concentrations of those three drugs, while cimetidine slightly increases the propafenone concentrations. Additive pharmacologic effect can occur when lidocaine, procainamide, and quinidine are combined with propafenone.

During a 20-year period from 1989 to 2008, 8 solid organ transplant recipients (63% males; median age, 48 years) developed Alternaria species infections at the Mayo Clinic. All patients were highly immunocompromised as evidenced by their receipt of multiple transplants, treatment of acute and chronic allograft rejection, and occurrence of other opportunistic infections. All patients presented with non-tender erythematous or violaceous skin papules, nodules, or pustules in exposed areas of the extremities. No case of visceral dissemination was observed. Itraconazole was the most common drug used for treatment, although voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin could potentially be useful based on our limited clinical data and in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing. One patient was treated with voriconazole, while another patient who was refractory to itraconazole had rapid resolution of lesions after the addition of caspofungin. Attempts at antifungal therapy alone were unsuccessful; all patients eventually required surgical excision of lesions. In conclusion, Alternaria species are rare but increasingly recognized opportunistic infections among highly immunocompromised transplant recipients. Wide excisional surgery combined with prolonged systemic antifungal therapy and reduction in immunosuppressive regimens provided the best chance of cure. Although itraconazole remains the most common drug for treatment, this case series highlights the potential clinical utility of caspofungin, voriconazole, and posaconazole as alternative regimens."}

Propranolol and verapamil caused a significant release of lactate dehydrogenase (used as cytotoxic index in this study) in the culture media in a concentration-dependent manner, with LC50 values of 220 +/- 10 and 224 +/- 7 mumol/L, respectively. Atenolol, sotalol and procainamide had no effect on lactate dehydrogenase release. Electron microscopy of the hepatocytes showed that subtoxic concentrations of propranolol (12.5 to 125 mumol/L) and verapamil (12.5 to 100 mumol/L) induced multilamellar inclusion bodies after 24 hr of incubation. The two higher concentrations of propranolol (50 and 125 mumol/L) and 100 mumol/L of verapamil produced a significant decrease in the percentage of volume density of the mitochondria as quantitated by morphometrical analysis. An unusual feature of the electron microscopical changes with propranolol and verapamil was the presence of mitochondria within the multilamellar inclusion bodies. When these two drugs were used together or with subtoxic concentrations of amiodarone or desethylamiodarone, release of lactate dehydrogenase was significantly enhanced. No correlation was evident between the cytotoxic response and the volume density of cellular inclusions in hepatocytes treated with different concentrations of propranolol, verapamil, amiodarone or desethylamiodarone. Sotalol, atenolol and procainamide in concentrations up to 400 mumol/L did not produce any ultrastructural changes in hepatocytes after 24 hr of incubation. These results show that (a) cationic amphiphilic structure per se is not the only requirement for induction of multilamellar inclusions, (b) propranolol and verapamil can induce the formation of multilamellar inclusion bodies and cause a concentration-dependent release of lactate dehydrogenase from hepatocytes and (c) combination of different cationic amphiphiles in subtoxic concentrations can enhance cytotoxicity and increase the volume density of multilamellar inclusions."}

They are mainly used to maintain remission in steroid-dependent disease or with ciclosporin to control a severe ulcerative colitis flare-up, as well as to prevent postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence, and also in combination therapy with biologics. About 30-40% of patients will not respond to treatment and 10-20% will not tolerate it due to adverse effects. Before they are prescribed, immunisation status against certain infections should be checked. Determination of thiopurine methyltransferase activity (TPMT) is not mandatory but it increases initial safety. The appropriate dose is 2.5mg/kg/day for azathioprine and 1.5mg/kg/day for mercaptopurine. Some adverse effects are idiosyncratic (digestive intolerance, pancreatitis, fever, arthromyalgia, rash and some forms of hepatotoxicity). Others are dose-dependent (myelotoxicity and other types of hepatotoxicity), and their surveillance should never be interrupted during treatment. If therapy fails or adverse effects develop, management can include switching from one thiopurine to the other, reducing the dose, combining low doses of azathioprine with allopurinol and assessing metabolites, before their use is ruled out. Non-melanoma skin cancer, lymphomas and urinary tract tumours have been linked to thiopurine therapy. Thiopurine use is safe during conception, pregnancy and breastfeeding."}

Although tamoxifen was the standard hormonal treatment for many years, we now have another option for postmenopausal women: the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. A number of trials have investigated the use of third-generation AIs compared with tamoxifen throughout the continuum of treatment settings for postmenopausal women with breast cancer. In the neoadjuvant setting, letrozole, given for 4 months, resulted in better overall clinical response and breast-conserving surgery rates than tamoxifen. The Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole Tamoxifen or Combined with Tamoxifen trial gave anastrozole for 3 months with no difference in clinical response but significantly improved breast-conserving surgery rates. Compared with tamoxifen, anastrozole and letrozole significantly improved disease-free survival as early adjuvant treatment for hormone-receptor-positive disease. Switching to anastrozole or exemestane after 2 to 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen for a total of 5 years of therapy was also more effective than continued tamoxifen. All three agents are approved in the early adjuvant or switching setting in the USA. Letrozole following 5 years of tamoxifen as extended adjuvant treatment improved disease-free survival and, in the node-positive subgroup, overall survival when compared with placebo. Anastrozole and letrozole are both approved for the first-line treatment of hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women; letrozole showed an improved response rate compared with tamoxifen. Anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane are all indicated for the second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer. In summary, third-generation AIs have been shown to have superior efficacy over tamoxifen in the metastatic, neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings and to improve outcome as extended adjuvant therapy following 5 years of tamoxifen. Ongoing studies will further define the role of sequential adjuvant treatment. Appropriate duration of treatment is another important area of investigation. This review will cover hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with breast cancer and will not address the treatment of premenopausal women."}

In recent phase I and II studies testing this new compound in patients who had failed to respond to interferon (IFN), hematological and cytogenetic responses were reported in most of those with chronic-phase CML. However, in some patients resistance has been associated with a single amino acid substitution in a threonine residue of the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies examining the effects of imatinib plus cytarabine (Ara-C) using CML cell lines and colony-forming assays of CML patient samples have shown synergistic antiproliferative effects of this combination. Thus several groups decided to investigate this new combination with the hypothesis that cell resistance would be less frequent. The CML French Group performed a phase II trial to determine the safety and tolerability of a combination of imatinib and Ara-C for previously untreated patients with chronic-phase CML. Treatment was administered on 28-day cycles for 12 months. Patients were treated continuously with imatinib orally at a dose of 400 mg daily. Ara-C was given on days 14 to 28 of each cycle at an initial dose of 20 mg/m(2)/d via subcutaneous injection, hydroxyurea (HU) being stopped at least 7 days before imatinib. Recently, the Dutch group decided to explore a combination of high-dose Ara-C with imatinib in patients in chronic-phase CML. Preliminary results are encouraging. However, a long follow-up is required before concluding that these strategies will overcome cell resistance."}

Isolated human blood neutrophils were activated with the chemoattractant N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) (1 \u03bcM) in combination with cytochalasin B (CB; 3 \u03bcM). Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester-based spectrofluorimetry, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, colorimetric and flow cytometric procedures were used to measure cytosolic Ca\u00b2(+) fluxes, production of superoxide, elastase release and beta-2 integrin (CR3) expression, respectively, while cyclic AMP and leukotriene (LT)B\u2084 were assayed using competitive binding ELISA procedures. Activation of the cells with fMLP/CB resulted in abrupt and sustained increases in cytosolic Ca\u00b2(+), as well as release of elastase and production of superoxide and LTB\u2084, and expression of CR3, all of which were attenuated by formoterol and montelukast individually, and especially by the combination of these agents. These anti-inflammatory effects of each agent, as well as the combination, were associated with significant increases in cyclic AMP. The findings of the current study may explain the efficacy of montelukast and formoterol when used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of severe asthma, possibly by controlling neutrophil-driven inflammation of the airways."}

Some patients respond to further hormonal manipulation. When metastatic disease becomes refractory, combination chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. For those patients refractory to CMF, salvage therapy should consist of single agents, such as mitomycin, doxorubicin, or vinblastine, or combinations of drugs not contained in the CMF regimen. As with single-agent therapy in previously untreated patients, remission durations are usually short. Two-drug combinations result in response rates from 30% to 50% and longer duration of remission. For patients refractory to FAC, doxorubicin is discontinued after reaching a cumulative dose, and therapy is continued with a CMF-type combination. Thus, both doxorubicin and methotrexate are used, and salvage chemotherapy is based on mitomycin and vinblastine. All agents used for salvage therapy of breast cancer may produce toxic effects. Appropriate surveillance and limiting the cumulative dose of drugs reduces the risk of irreversible toxic effects."}

One such area of research involves the interoceptive stimulus effects of nicotine as either a discriminative stimulus in an operant drug discrimination task, or more recently as a conditional stimulus (CS) in a discriminated goal-tracking task. The present work investigated the potential role nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play in the CS effects of nicotine (0.4mg/kg) using antagonists with differential selectivity for beta2*, alpha7*, alpha6beta2*, and alpha3beta4* receptors. Methyllycaconitine (MLA) had no effect on nicotine-evoked conditioned responding. Mecamylamine and dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE) dose-dependently blocked responding evoked by the nicotine CS. In a time-course assessment of mecamylamine and DHbetaE, each blocked conditioned responding when given 5min before testing and still blocked conditioned responding when administered 200min before testing. Two novel bis-picolinium analogs (N, N'-(3, 3'-(dodecan-1,12-diyl)-bis-picolinium dibromide [bPiDDB], and N, N'-(decan-1,10-diyl)-bis-picolinium diiodide [bPiDI]) did not block nicotine-evoked conditioned responding. Finally, pretreatment with low dose combinations of mecamylamine, dextromethorphan, and/or bupropion was used to target alpha3beta4* receptors. No combination blocked conditioned responding evoked by the training dose of nicotine. However, a combination of mecamylamine and dextromethorphan partially blocked nicotine-evoked conditioned responding to a lower dose of nicotine (0.1mg/kg). These results indicate that beta2* and potentially alpha3beta4* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a role in the CS effects of nicotine and are potential targets for the development of nicotine cessation aids."}

(3) Marketing authorisation was based on the short-term results of a double-blind trial comparing anastrozole (1 mg/day) with tamoxifen (20 mg/day) in 9366 women. The trial is planned to last five years. The results obtained after median follow-up of 4 years showed no difference between the groups in overall survival (109 deaths in each group). But first pathological events were significantly less frequent in the group taking anastrozole (13% versus 15%). Note that these results are undermined by a number of methodological flaws, including relatively short follow-up and definition of relapses using an endpoint mixing heterogeneous prognostic factors. (4) Musculoskeletal disorders, fractures (7.1% versus 4.4%) and hypercholesterolemia were statistically more common with anastrozole than with tamoxifen. Women taking anastrozole found their sex lives less satisfactory than women taking tamoxifen. The following adverse events were statistically less common with anastrozole than with tamoxifen: hot flushes (35.0% versus 40.3%), metrorrhagia, venous thromboembolism (1.1% versus 1.8%), ischaemic stroke (1.1% versus 2.3%), and endometrial cancer (3 versus 15 cases at 4 years). (5) In practice, anastrozole may be beneficial for women who cannot use tamoxifen, such as those at high risk of thrombosis. Anastrozole costs ten times more per day than tamoxifen. Tamoxifen remains the reference adjuvant treatment for all other women."}

Patients received a combination of adriamycin and ifosfamide (AI) or a combination of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). On days 1-5, all patients received intravenous granisetron (1\u00a0mg) and intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate (24\u00a0mg). Olanzapine was administrated on day-1 to day5 at bedtime. The dose of olanzapine followed a dose-escalation scheme, with monitoring of safety and tolerability at each dose. A 3\u00a0+\u00a03 cohort design was used, with three to six patients per cohort. Results Nine patients were enrolled (three for each cohort). No patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The most frequent adverse events were dry mouth and constipation.

However, the development of an oral formulation is difficult due to paclitaxel's low oral bioavailability, caused by its low permeability and low solubility. We increased the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel by combining a pharmacokinetic booster, ritonavir, with a new oral solid dispersion formulation of paclitaxel. The combined use of Hansen solubility parameters and dissolution experiments resulted in the development of a solid dispersion formulation containing 1/11 w/w paclitaxel, 9/11 w/w polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and 1/11 w/w sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). Analysis of the solid dispersion formulation by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and modulated differential scanning calorimetry (mDSC) confirmed the amorphous nature of paclitaxel and the fine dispersion of paclitaxel in the matrix of PVP-K30 and SLS. Furthermore, in vitro tests showed a major increase in the apparent solubility and dissolution rate of paclitaxel. To test the clinical significance of these findings, the solid dispersion formulation of paclitaxel (ModraPac001 10mg capsule) was compared to the paclitaxel premix solution in four patients with advanced cancer. Although the mean systemic exposure to paclitaxel after oral administration of the solid dispersion formulation was slightly lower compared to the paclitaxel premix solution (190\u00b163.1ng/mLh for vs. 247\u00b1100ng/mLh), the systemic exposure to paclitaxel is clinically relevant [1,2]. In addition to this, the favorable pharmaceutical characteristics, for example, neutral taste, dosing accuracy, and the 2-year ambient shelf life, make the ModraPac001 10mg capsule an attractive candidate for oral paclitaxel chemotherapy. Currently, the ModraPac001 formulation is applied in the first clinical trial with oral LDM chemotherapy of paclitaxel."}

The cytotoxic drugs are characterised by steep dose-response relationships and narrow therapeutic windows. Inter-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability is often substantial. There are, however, a multitude of reasons why TDM has never been fully implemented in daily oncology practice. These include difficulties in establishing appropriate concentration target, common use of combination chemotherapies and the paucity of published data from pharmacological trials. The situation is different with targeted therapies. The large interindividual PK variability is influenced by the pharmacogenetic background of the patient (e.g. cytochrome P450 and ABC transporters polymorphisms), patient characteristics such as adherence to treatment and environmental factors (drug-drug interactions). Retrospective studies have shown that targeted drug exposure correlates with treatment response in various cancers. Evidence for imatinib currently exists, others are emerging for compounds including nilotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, sunitinib, sorafenib and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Applications for TDM during oral targeted therapies may best be reserved for particular situations including lack of therapeutic response, severe or unexpected toxicities, anticipated drug-drug interactions and concerns over adherence treatment. There are still few data with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in favour of TDM approaches, even if data showed encouraging results with rituximab and cetuximab. TDM of mAbs is not yet supported by scientific evidence. Considerable effort should be made for targeted therapies to better define concentration-effect relationships and to perform comparative randomised trials of classic dosing versus pharmacokinetically-guided adaptive dosing.

To investigate this, tumor cells of a murine model of a T-cell lymphoma, designated as Dalton's lymphoma, and obtained from high and low cell density environment in vitro and in vivo, were transplanted in mice with or without the administration of anticancer drugs followed by analysis of their phenotypic properties and tumorigenic potential as measured by kinetics of tumor growth and survival of the tumor-bearing host.

Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, showed promise in earlier stages of clinical development, but ultimately failed to demonstrate efficacy as a single agent in the treatment of melanoma. In order to enhance the efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment of melanoma, we tested over 2,000 naturally occurring compounds and marketed drugs in the presence of sorafenib in chemoresistant human melanoma cell lines also resistant to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Of the 9 compounds identified as sorafenib sensitizers, we prioritized the cholesterol-lowering agent fluvastatin, based on its favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile. Our results demonstrate that fluvastatin at 1 \u03bcM, a level safely achieved through oral administration, dramatically enhances the growth-inhibitory activity of clinically achievable concentrations of sorafenib in M14 and SKM-173 melanoma cells, with a 3.2- and 3.6-fold reduction in sorafenib 50% growth inhibition (GI50), respectively. Similar effects were observed for other melanoma cell lines. Combination indices analysis revealed a synergistic relationship between the two agents. Fluvastatin enhances sorafenib-mediated apoptosis as revealed through enhanced cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In combination with sorafenib, fluvastatin treatment results in reduced levels of activated murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog along with enhanced levels of activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Sensitization to sorafenib is unique to fluvastatin, as other statins (pravastatin and simvastatin) do not enhance sorafenib-mediated growth inhibition. These promising results warrant further investigation into the clinical applicability of fluvastatin as an agent for enhancing the efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment of melanoma."}

Sixteen months after the patient received chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin plus radiotherapy, his recurrent mediastinal metastases were found to have progressed. Treatment with erlotinib was followed by an initial, partial response but evidence of progression was again observed 6 months later.

One month later, progression of mediastinal metastases was again observed and the patient received a second course of erlotinib. Another partial response occurred and the patient's disease remained stable at the 9-month follow-up visit (and with no reported symptom progression at an 11-month telephone follow-up). Genetic examination of tumour tissue collected at the time of the original diagnosis and during the second course of erlotinib therapy revealed activating exon 19 mutation in the EGFR gene.

Higher doses of both agents were administered in this latter schedule, with higher overall response rates reported. Excessive cardiac toxicity was reported with the initial trials that used this schedule. Confirmatory studies are under way pursuing several alternatives to reduce the risk of cardiac toxicity; these include limiting the cumulative dose of doxorubicin, inserting an interval between the administration of the two drugs, and adding a cardioprotective agent to the combination. The high degree of antitumor activity of this combination is quite encouraging, and additional evaluation of this regimen in controlled trials is warranted in metastatic and high-risk primary breast cancer."}

In the first experiment, acute clozapine injections (4.0-16.0 mg/kg) produced a dose-related suppression of the vacuous jaw movements induced by 0.4 mg/kg physostigmine. In the second experiment, acute injections of clozapine (2.0-16.0 mg/kg) also suppressed vacuous jaw movements induced by 4.0 mg/kg pilocarpine in a dose-related manner. The third experiment was designed to compare the effects of acute and repeated administration of 16.0 mg/kg clozapine. In this experiment, there were three groups: one that received 4.0 mg/kg pilocarpine, a second group that received pilocarpine plus an acute injection of 16.0 mg/kg clozapine, and a third group that received injections of 16.0 mg/kg clozapine for 14 consecutive days, including the final day in which they also were injected with pilocarpine. For the third experiment, animals were assessed for the sedative effects of clozapine as well as vacuous jaw movements. The results indicated that either acute or repeated injections of 16.0 mg/kg clozapine reduced vacuous jaw movements relative to rats that received pilocarpine alone, and the two clozapine-treated groups did not differ from each other. The sedation ratings indicated that acute injections of 16.0 mg/kg clozapine produced substantial drowsiness and sedation, whereas rats that had received clozapine for 14 days did not show substantial sedation. These results indicate that clozapine can suppress cholinomimetic-induced vacuous jaw movements. The suppressive effects of clozapine on pilocarpine-induced vacuous jaw movements do not show tolerance within the 14-day period of repeated injections, whereas the sedative effects of clozapine do show tolerance. Thus, these results demonstrate that the suppression of pilocarpine-induced vacuous jaw movements by clozapine is not merely an artifact of clozapine-induced sedation. Because pilocarpine-induced vacuous jaw movements share some characteristics with human parkinsonian symptoms, the present results are consistent with previous reports indicating that repeated injections of clozapine produce anti-parkinsonian effects."}

The mean age was 29.39 +/- 9.38 years (16-55 years), with six patients (8.6%) being older than 39 years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 79.74 +/- 40.44 months (6-157 months). Forty patients (57.14%) were diagnosed after molar pregnancy, 22 (31.43%) after abortion, and 8 (11.43%) after term pregnancy. Forty-two patients (60%) were diagnosed within 4 months of the occurrence of the disease, and 28 (40%) were diagnosed after more than 4 months. Sixty-seven patients were treated using different regimens according to the protocol of treatment at that time. The MAC regimen was used initially but has been subsequently abandoned in favor of EMA-CO (etoposide, methotrexate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine [Oncovin]) regimen, which was later modified by omitting the CO arm to decrease its toxicity. If resistance developed, platinum-based therapy was given in the form of EMA-EP. Recently, our unit incorporated paclitaxel in the third-line treatment. Surgical intervention was used selectively. Fifty-seven (81.4%) patients could be cured; 43 by initial chemotherapy, with a mean of 7 +/- 0.46 courses (6-15), and 14 were salvaged by second- or third-line chemotherapy. Fourteen patients (20%) died during the study period; one was unrelated to GTT, while three died of acute respiratory distress syndrome before instituting proper therapy and two died of treatment complications. Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, the presence of brain and/or liver metastases was found to be the worst prognostic variable affecting the survival, followed by resistance to combination chemotherapy and then the type of antecedent pregnancy. The projected 5-year survival as estimated by Kaplan-Meier method was 78%."}

Transducing particles of the former phage, named 5006MHFTsus, were detected using the replica-plate technique in an ultraviolet-induced lysate of Proteus mirabilis strain PM5006 transduced to streptomycin and sulphonamide resistance by phage 5006M grown on PM5006 carrying R905. Phage 5006MHFTsusk was also detected by the replica-plate technique in ultraviolet-induced lysates of of phage 5006MHFTsus transductants retransduced to ampicillin and kanamycin resistance by phage 5006MHFTak. Both phages were serologically identical to the parent phage 5006M. Ultraviolet-induced lysates transduced their markers to PM5006 at frequencies of about 5 X 10(-2)/plaque-forming unit adsorbed for both the phages. With phage 5006MHFTsusk, this frequency was increased about 10-fold by simultaneous infection of recipients with homologous non-transducing phage, while phage 5006MHFTsus transductions only underwent a twofold increase. Transductants took about 60 min to express complete resistance to 50 mug streptomycin/ml, and resistance to 1600 mug sulphadiazine/ml was complete within 120 min after phage adsorption. Phage 5006MHFTsusk was slightly more resistant to ultraviolet inaction of its transducing potential and reasons are given for the belief that transductants of both phages are heterogenote-like. Both phage lysates were also capable of generalized transduction and, like previously described HFT phages, lysates transduced the leucine marker at increased frequencies. Using previously described extra- and intra-species phages hosts, it was found that the phages could transduce in single infection and were defective in the lysogenic conversion function as well as in a maturation step. Possible modes of formation of the HFT particles are discussed9"}

The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether intake of ethanol and saccharin-quinine (SQ) solutions would be related in three nonselected strains of rats who differ in their ethanol preference: Lewis, Wistar Kyoto, and Wistar. In the first phase of the experiment, all animals were presented with an ascending series of ethanol solutions (2 to 10%) in free choice with water, followed by a 10-day maintenance period of 10% ethanol with water. In the second phase, the same animals were presented with an ascending series of SQ solutions (saccharin: 0.4%, quinine: 0.001 to 0.04%) in free choice with water, followed by a 10-day maintenance period of 0.4% saccharin with 0.04% quinine and water. The results revealed an absence of a direct relationship between ethanol and SQ consumption. The ethanol-nonpreferring Lewis rats showed a greater preference for the SQ solutions than Wistar Kyoto rats, whereas the ethanol-preferring Wistar Kyoto strain consistently consumed significantly less SQ. Wistar rats showed relatively stable consumption levels for both solutions that fell between those of the other two strains. These results suggested that the relationship between ethanol and SQ preference in rats was not a direct one and did not support the findings in the literature of a simple overall positive relationship between sweet and ethanol preference. These data do, however, provide further evidence for taste factors in the mediation of self-selection of ethanol in rats."}

In well designed trials, valdecoxib demonstrated efficacy versus placebo in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), primary dysmenorrhoea and postoperative pain. Initial results in patients with migraine headache were promising. The efficacy of valdecoxib appears dose dependent up to 40 mg/day. Valdecoxib 10 mg/day was as effective as naproxen and rofecoxib in improving signs and symptoms of OA. The American College of Rheumatology 20% response rate was similar in recipients of valdecoxib, naproxen and diclofenac in patients with RA. In patients with dysmenorrhoea, valdecoxib 20 or 40 mg up to twice daily provided as effective pain relief as naproxen sodium 550 mg twice daily. In acute post-surgical pain, single-dose valdecoxib 40 mg had a rapid onset of action, provided similar analgesia to oxycodone 10 mg plus paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1000 mg and provided a longer time to rescue medication than rofecoxib or oxycodone/paracetamol after oral surgery. Pre-emptive administration of valdecoxib 10-80 mg was particularly effective in dental pain. Valdecoxib had opioid-sparing effects after hip or knee arthroplasty and reduced pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Valdecoxib is generally well tolerated. The incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers was generally lower than with nonselective NSAIDs (i.e. NSAIDs not specifically developed as selective COX-2 inhibitors). With concomitant aspirin, the ulcer rate in valdecoxib recipients increased significantly, but was still lower than that in recipients of aspirin plus nonselective NSAIDs. In conclusion, valdecoxib, a COX-2-selective inhibitor, is as efficacious in pain relief as nonselective NSAIDs, with better gastrointestinal tolerability. It was as effective in RA, OA and primary dysmenorrhoea (the approved indications) as nonselective NSAIDs and as effective as rofecoxib in RA flare. In acute post-surgical pain, valdecoxib provided similar pain relief to oxycodone/paracetamol, had a long duration of action, a rapid onset of analgesia and was opioid-sparing.

However, its prolonged treatment develops multidrug resistance. Since lapatinib interacts with and inhibits P-gp activity, our objective was to determine whether the combination therapy of these two drugs can synergistically treat resistant prostate cancer. Our recently synthesized lipopolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxylpropylene carbonate-graft-dodecanol) (PEG-PCD), was used to efficiently load both drugs into PEG-PCD micelles since they are hydrophobic. Lapatinib inhibited P-gp function but not its expression. Co-treatment of DU145-TXR cells with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM paclitaxel and 5\u00a0\u03bcM lapatinib resulted in up to 138-fold reversal compared to paclitaxel alone. These formulations killed almost 70% and 80% of DU145-TXR cells when 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM paclitaxel was combined with lapatinib at a dose of 1 and 5\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively, while monotherapy had no effect. Combination therapy induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at mitotic phase. Xenograft tumor growth in athymic nude mice was significantly regressed when PEG-PCD micelles carrying lapatinib and paclitaxel were given intravenously twice a week. Furthermore, this combination therapy synergistically decreased antiangiogenic activity compared to the control or their monotherapy. In conclusion, lipopolymeric micelles carrying lapatinib and paclitaxel have the potential to treat resistant prostate cancer and can successfully deliver drugs to tumors while minimizing toxic effects associated with solubilizing agents.

Mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) have been recently described as a molecular-specific feature in endometrial carcinomas and the presence of activated FGFR2 mutations is associated with poor prognosis. For that reason, inhibition of FGFR2 could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of endometriod carcinomas. In this work, we investigated the antitumoral activity of dovitinib (a multiple kinase inhibitor) in human endometrial cancer cell (ECC) lines. We found that dovitinib caused cell growth arrest, loss of clonogenic growth, and cell-cycle arrest in FGFR2-mutated ECCs in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Next, we investigated the mechanistic basis of dovitinib effects. We could determine that dovitinib modified expression levels of well-known key cell-cycle regulatory proteins that induce cellular senescence. To further investigate the role of dovitinib, we analyzed its effect on estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) expression. Surprisingly, we discovered that dovitinib enhances ER-\u03b1 expression in FGFR2-mutant ECCs. Because blocking one signaling pathway is often not sufficient to cause total tumor regression and the effectiveness of individual inhibitors is often short-lived, we examined the impact of targeting FGFR2 with dovitinib in combination with a selective ER antagonist, fulvestrant (ICI182.780). Combination of dovitinib plus ICI182.780 resulted in a significantly higher inhibition of cell growth than dovitinib treatment alone. These findings suggest that combinatory therapies using dovitinib plus ICI182.780 treatment can be truly effective in patients with endometrial carcinomas carrying FGFR2 mutations."}

All of the isolates were analysed for the presence of carbapenemases, extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC enzymes and outer-membrane proteins. None of the isolates exhibited carbapenemase activity nor did they have any of the carbapenemase genes that were screened for. Most of the 61 strains produced at least one ESBL and/or one AmpC enzyme and either lost their porins or had altered porins according to sequence analysis. The distribution of ESBLs and AmpC enzymes was different among the species studied. Resistance in K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates was associated with ESBLs; in M. morganii isolates, resistance was attributed to overexpression of an AmpC enzyme; and in Enterobacter spp. isolates, resistance was associated with both types of enzymes. In K. pneumoniae isolates, porin integrity was more a determinant of carbapenem resistance than the presence of ESBLs, whereas in isolates of Enterobacter spp., M. morganii and S. marcescens, the presence of an overexpressed AmpC enzyme was associated with higher imipenem and meropenem MIC values. Therefore, carbapenem resistance in Chilean isolates is not due to true carbapenemases but rather to a combination of porin loss/alteration and \u03b2-lactamase activity. The fact that carbapenemases were not detected in this study is unique, given that many countries in the region have already reported the presence of these enzymes."}

Treatment resulted in an overall response rate (RR) of 85% with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.3\u00a0months. Bone pain, fatigue, headache, and neutropenia were the most common adverse effects. Infusion-related reactions were the most common adverse event related to bavituximab therapy. Correlative studies showed an increase in the PS-expressing apoptotic circulating tumor cells in response to bavituximab, but not with paclitaxel. No changes in the number of circulating endothelial cells or apoptotic endothelial cells were observed with therapy. Platelet and monocyte-derived microparticles decreased after initiation of bavituximab. Bavituximab in combination with paclitaxel is well tolerated for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer with promising results observed in terms of clinical RRs and PFS. The toxicity profile of bavituximab is notable for manageable infusion-related reactions with no evidence for increased thrombogenicity. Recent preclinical data suggest that bavituximab can also promote antitumor immune activity that should be explored in future clinical trials. "}

Early-onset PVE (ie, 60 days or fewer postsurgery) typically is nosocomial, with Staphylococcus aureus infection being most common. Intermediate-onset PVE (ie, 60 to 365 days postsurgery) typically involves a mix of nosocomial and non-nosocomial organisms. PVE that develops more than 1 year after surgery has microbiology similar to that of native valve endocarditis. Fever is the most common symptom; others include dyspnea, pleuritic pain, anorexia, and myalgias. The Modified Duke Criteria is the standard for diagnosis, with blood cultures being the most important test. If patients are in stable condition, three sets of blood cultures should be obtained more than 6 hours apart and from separate sites before starting antibiotics. Echocardiography aids in diagnosis and can identify conditions best managed with surgery. For empiric therapy for native valve IE, most patients should receive vancomycin. For PVE, vancomycin and gentamicin should be prescribed, plus cefepime or an antipseudomonal carbapenem. Treatment typically continues for 6 weeks after blood culture results are negative."}

Oxidative stress-related proteins were considered as useful biomarkers of hepatotoxicity; since they were detected by immunohistochemistry and proteomics analysis prior to appearance of compound-specific histopathological changes detected by light microscopy. Considering the relevance of in vitro system to in vivo system from the aspect of new biomarkers related to the toxicogenomics/toxicoproteomics, in vitro primary cell culture system would be sufficient to detect hepatotoxicity in the early stage of drug discovery."}

In a recent Phase III trial (OPTiM), talimogene laherparepvec significantly improved durable response rate compared with subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Overall response rate was also higher in the talimogene laherparepvec arm, and the greatest efficacy was demonstrated in patients with earlier-stage (IIIB, IIIC, or IVM1a) melanoma. Talimogene laherparepvec was well tolerated, with the majority (89%) of adverse events being grade 1 or 2. Preclinical studies have shown that talimogene laherparepvec exerts antitumor activity by selectively replicating within and destroying cancer cells, and through the release of tumor-associated antigens and expression of GM-CSF, which facilitates a wider antitumor immune response. It is hypothesized that combining talimogene laherparepvec with a systemic immunotherapy may, by bringing together complementary mechanisms of action, further enhance the efficacy of both agents. Indeed, talimogene laherparepvec is currently being assessed in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, in trials for melanoma and other solid tumors. Early results in melanoma indicate that the combination of talimogene laherparepvec with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab has greater efficacy than either therapy alone, without additional safety concerns above those expected for each monotherapy. In this review, we discuss the latest results from trials assessing talimogene laherparepvec in combination with other immunotherapies, provide an overview of ongoing and upcoming combination trials, and suggest future directions for talimogene laherparepvec in combination therapy for solid tumors."}

Vandetanib and cabozantinib are two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that were recently approved by FDA and EMA for systemic treatment of metastatic MTC. Additionally, since MTC is of a neuroendocrine tumour type, treatment with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues (e.g. 177Lu-octreotate) is a valid option for patients with MTC. The aim of this study was to investigate the potentially increased therapeutic effect of combining radiation therapy with these TKIs for treatment of MTC in a mouse model. Nude mice carrying patient-derived MTC tumours (GOT2) were treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and/or one of the two TKIs vandetanib or cabozantinib. The tumour volume was determined and compared with that of mock-treated controls. The treatment doses were chosen to give a moderate effect as monotherapy to be able to detect any increased therapeutic effect from the combination therapy. At the end of follow-up, tumours were processed for immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. The animals in the combination therapy groups showed the largest reduction in tumour volume and the longest time to tumour progression. Two weeks after start of treatment, the tumour volume for these mice was reduced by about 70-75% compared with controls. Furthermore, also EBRT and TKI monotherapy resulted in a clear anti-tumour effect with a reduced tumour growth compared with controls. The results show that an increased therapeutic effect could be achieved when irradiation is combined with TKIs for treatment of MTC. Future studies should evaluate the potential of using 177Lu-octreotate therapy in combination with TKIs in patients."}

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a leading cause of cancer mortality with a dismal 2-5 % 5-year survival rate. Monotherapy with Gemcitabine has limited success, highlighting the need for additional therapies that enhance the efficacy of current treatments. We evaluated the combination of Gemcitabine and Rosiglitazone, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of type II diabetes, in an immunocompetent transplantable mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Tumor progression, survival, and metastases were evaluated in immunocompetent mice with subcutaneous or orthotopic pancreatic tumors treated with Pioglitazone, Rosiglitazone, Gemcitabine, or combinations of these. We characterized the impact of high-dose Rosiglitazone and Gemcitabine therapy on immune suppressive mediators, including MDSC and T regulatory cells, and on modulation of peripheral and intra-tumoral T cell populations. Combinations of Rosiglitazone and Gemcitabine significantly reduced tumor progression and metastases, enhanced apoptosis, and significantly extended overall survival compared to Gemcitabine alone. Rosiglitazone altered tumor-associated immune suppressive mediators by limiting early MDSC accumulation and intra-tumoral T regulatory cells. Combination therapy with Rosiglitazone and Gemcitabine modulated T cell populations by enhancing circulating CD8(+) T cells and intra-tumoral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells while limiting T regulatory cells. The results suggest that Rosiglitazone, in combination with Gemcitabine, decreases immune suppressive mechanisms in immunocompetent animals and provides pre-clinical data in support of combining Rosiglitazone and Gemcitabine as a clinical therapy for pancreatic cancer."}

Bleomycin is thought to be growth inhibitory by virtue of its ability to oxidatively damage DNA through its complex with iron. Our previous preclinical studies showed that bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity can be reduced by pretreatment with the doxorubicin cardioprotective agent dexrazoxane. Dexrazoxane is thought to protect against iron-based oxygen radical damage through the iron chelating ability of its hydrolyzed metabolite ADR-925, an analog of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). ADR-925 quickly and effectively displaced either ferrous or ferric iron from its complex with bleomycin. This result suggests that dexrazoxane may have the potential to antagonize the iron-dependent growth inhibitory effects of bleomycin. A study was undertaken to determine if dexrazoxane could antagonize bleomycin-mediated cytotoxicity using a CHO-derived cell line (DZR) that was highly resistant to dexrazoxane through a threonine-48 to isoleucine mutation in topoisomerase IIalpha. Dexrazoxane is also a cell growth inhibitor that acts through its ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II. Thus, the DZR cell line allowed us to examine the cell growth inhibitory effects of bleomycin in the presence of dexrazoxane without the confounding effect of dexrazoxane inhibiting cell growth. The cell growth inhibitory effects of bleomycin were unaffected by pretreating DZR cells with dexrazoxane. These results suggest that dexrazoxane may be clinically used in combination with bleomycin as a pulmonary protective agent without adversely affecting the antitumor activity of bleomycin."}

We describe the experience of our multidisciplinary team of endocrinologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, oncologists, otolaryngologists and pathologists with TMZ and pasireotide treatment for aggressive PAs in terms of their radiological shrinkage and genetic features. We considered five patients with aggressive PA, three of them non-secreting (two ACTH-silent and one becoming ACTH secreting), and two secreting (one GH and one ACTH). TMZ was administrated orally at 150-200 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days every 28 days to all 5 patients, and 2 of them also received pasireotide 600-900 \u00b5g bid sc. We assessed the MRI at the baseline and during TMZ or pasireotide treatment. We also checked for MGMT promoter methylation and IDH, BRAF and kRAS mutations. Considering TMZ, two patients showed PA progression, one stable disease and two achieved radiological and clinical response. Pasireotide was effective in reducing hypercortisolism and mass volume, combined with TMZ in one case. Both treatments were generally well tolerated; one patient developed a grade 2 TMZ-induced thrombocytopenia. None of patients developed hypopituitarism while taking TMZ or pasireotide treatment.

Three-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 41.1 and 72.0 %, respectively. A complete response (CR) after HDM/ASCT was a strong prognostic factor for PFS and OS (p = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively).

The average age of the respondents was 27.0 \u00b1 0.5 years. The work experience of the respondents ranged from 0.5 to 34 years (average experience 5.64 \u00b1 0.41 years).Almost all pharmacists (97%) reported that they dispense antimicrobial drugs every day and consult patients about the choice and characteristics of antibiotic (99.5%). However, only 20% of the respondents indicated that they refuse to recommend antibiotics to the pharmacy visitors and send them to the doctor. Most often pharmaceutical employees recommended azithromycin (45%), amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid (41%), amoxicillin (26%). According to respondents, the choice of recommended antibiotic mostly depends (score on a scale of 1-5) on pharmacological characteristics of the drug: the effectiveness (of 4.66 \u00b1 0.04) and safety (4.16 \u00b1 0.07). Thus, pharmaceutical specialist should be knowledgeable about characteristics of antimicrobial agents to conduct proper consultation.According to the results of self-assessment of respondents' knowledge about antibiotics it is at an average level. 36.3% of respondents state that they are familiar with the range and features of most of the drugs. 41.8% of professionals are familiar with the range of the most popular drugs and their main features. Only 16.5% of respondents assess their knowledge about antibiotics at the highest level, indicating that they are fully familiar with the range and features of the drugs.Aiming at identifying knowledge about the side effects of antibiotics pharmacists were asked to compare the most commonly prescribed drugs and their respective side effects, to position the drugs and groups of drugs in the range according to the degree of toxicity and to indicate which antibiotics can be used during pregnancy. Knowledge of pharmaceutical workers is mainly limited to the perceptions of non-specific side reactions that can occur when taking any antibiotic (dyspepsia, allergic reactions, headache, candidiasis). 54.9% of respondents rightly pointed out nonspecific reactions for all 7 mentioned drug, for individual drugs the proportion of correct answers varied from 65,4% (linezolid) to 81,3% (amoxicillin+clavulanic acid).

The proportion of correct answers ranged from 6,0% for the combination amoxicillin+clavulanic acid to 43,4% for cefixime and doxycycline. The relationship between knowledge of respondents and frequency of recommendations of the same group of drugs could not be determined.Pharmacists assume that the safest antibiotics are macrolides (average rank place of 2,99 \u00b1 0,15 of 8), cephalosporins (3,12 \u00b1 0,15) and penicillins (3,38 \u00b1 0,22), the most toxic are tetracyclines (5,61 \u00b1 0,17). It should be noted that average rank places are quite similar, which means serious differences of opinion between the specialists. When assessing the toxicity of individual drugs a combination of amoxicillin+clavulanic acid (average rank place of 2,92 \u00b1 0,29 of 15) and ampicillin (of 4,88 \u00b1 0,36) were considered as the safest, the most toxic were tetracycline (10,13 \u00b1 0,30) and gentamicin (10,14 \u00b1 0,33). These perceptions are generally consistent with the views on the safety of antibiotics in outpatient practice [3].Half of the respondents (51,1%) correctly identified the antibiotics that can be used during pregnancy (FDA category B). 45,1% of respondents said that no antibiotics can be used during pregnancy. Only 2,7% of respondents named drugs contraindicated during pregnancy (category C and D) - gentamicin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin."}

Antiplatelet therapy constitutes a mainstay therapy for patients with acute coronary syndromes and generally high-risk patients with atherothrombosis. Until recently, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for the treatment and prevention of the complications of atherothrombotic disease was traditionally limited to aspirin plus clopidogrel. However, a most important pertaining issue emerged, that of the occurrence of drug-resistance or tolerance observed in some patients for both these antithrombotic agents, which limited the efficacy and applicability of this combined therapy.The availability of the newer thienopyridine, prasugrel, and the cyclopentyl-triazolopyrimidine, ticagrelor, represents an important addition to the physician's armamentarium. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or one of the newer agents interferes with platelet activation in complementary, but separate pathways. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase, thus preventing the production of thromboxane A2, which is a prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive substance. Thienopyridines (clopidogrel/prasugrel) irreversibly and ticagrelor reversibly prevent and inhibit platelet activation by blocking one of the three known adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) receptors (the P2Y12 receptor) on the platelet surface, thus interfering with platelet activation, degranulation and aggregation. Each of these antiplatelet agents has a protective effect against adverse vascular events; classical DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel has an even stronger antiplatelet effect compared with either agent alone, however DAPT combining aspirin with one of the newer more potent agents translates into superior antithrombotic protection in atherothrobotic vascular disease, albeit at an increased, though not inordinately, risk for bleeding complications. A number of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated and confirmed the incremental benefit and efficacy of DAPT with use of either classical or newer agents, above and beyond that of each antiplatelet agent alone. Data have also been obtained from studies where indications for the use of DAPT continue to expand into other patient groups, rendering and maintaining DAPT a sweeping combination in Cardiology. This article is a comprehensive review of all these data and the landmark trials on the two classical and also the newer antiplatelet agents, the issues involved and the current recommendations for their use in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders and procedures."}

This lack of response might be explained by mechanisms for tamoxifen resistance that sensitize ER pathways to small amounts of estrogenic activity present in tamoxifen or that bypass ER pathways completely. To elucidate one possible mechanism of tamoxifen resistance, we treated ovariectomized tumor-bearing mice injected with fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-transfected MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells with the steroidal antiestrogen ICI 182,780 or one of two aromatase inhibitors, 4-OHA or letrozole. These treatments did not slow estrogen-independent growth or prevent metastasis of tumors produced by FGF-transfected MCF-7 cells in ovariectomized nude mice. FGF-transfected cells had diminished responses to ICI 182,780 in vitro, suggesting that autocrine activity of the transfected FGF may be replacing estrogen as a mitogenic stimulus for tumor growth. ER levels in FGF transfectants were not down-regulated, and basal levels of transcripts for estrogen-induced genes or of ER-mediated transcription of estrogen response element (ERE) luciferase reporter constructs in the FGF expressing cells were not higher than parental cells, implying that altered hormonal responses are not due to down-regulation of ER or to FGF-mediated activation of ER.

If so, therapies directed at the operative mechanism might produce a therapeutic response or allow a response to a second course of antiestrogen treatment."}

She was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer (luminal A type) T4dN2M0, Stage IIIB. The patient underwent primary systemic therapy with 7 courses of FEC. Following FEC treatment, the disease was stable. We subsequently administered 4 courses of bevacizumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy. The patient exhibited a partial response to FEC chemotherapy. Thereafter, a left mastectomy with level II axillary lymph node dissection was performed.

In patients with a first relapse in the viscera, VEGF levels were higher compared with those that relapsed to the bone or soft tissue (P = 0.0004). In univariate analysis for response to first-line tamoxifen therapy, patients with high or intermediate levels showed a poor rate of response, compared with patients with low tumor-VEGF levels (P = 0.0001). Similarly, in multivariate analysis for response to tamoxifen treatment, corrected for age, site of relapse, disease-free interval, and estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status, VEGF status was an independent predictive factor (P = 0.009). In concordance, higher levels of VEGF were associated with a short progression-free survival and postrelapse overall survival (both, P < 0.0001). On first-line chemotherapy, the rate of response decreased with higher tumor levels of VEGF, both in univariate (P = 0.003) and in multivariate analysis (P = 0.004). Furthermore, higher VEGF levels were associated with a short progression-free survival (P = 0.003) and postrelapse overall survival (P = 0.001). In conclusion, the tumor VEGF level is an important independent marker that predicts a poor efficacy of both tamoxifen and chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. Knowledge of the tumor level of VEGF might be helpful in selecting individual patients who may benefit from treatments with antiangiogenic agents combined with conventionally used drugs."}

Nilvadipine, nisoldipine, and verapamil, which showed antioxidant effects both before and after the addition of active oxygen, and reduced the dihydroxyfumarate (DHF) auto-oxidation rate, were chain-breaking and preventive antioxidants. Felodipine, which showed antioxidant effects both before and after exposure to active oxygen and increased the DHF auto-oxidation rate, was only a chain-breaking antioxidant. Nicardipine, which showed an antioxidant effect only before exposure to active oxygen and reduced the DHF auto-oxidation rate, was mainly a preventive antioxidant. Benidipine, which showed an antioxidant effect only before exposure to active oxygen and had no appreciable effect on the DHF auto-oxidation rate, could interrupt the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation at the initial step alone.

Under control conditions, the ACh-induced channels had three conductance states, 10, 20, and 33 pS, at a temperature of 10 degrees. The intermediate conductance state (20 pS) was the most prevalent. Moreover, an excessive number of very short events was observed which contributed to a deviation of the channel open-time distribution from a single-exponential function. At 20 degrees, the amplitude of these currents was increased (Q10 = 1.4), and the mean channel open time was decreased (Q10 = 3). Bupivacaine and its quaternary derivative (5-50 microM), when inside the patch micropipette with ACh, caused shortening of the channel open time, but the single-channel conductance remained unchanged at all concentrations studied. In the presence of bupivacaine, there was a loss of voltage dependence of the mean channel open time seen under control conditions; i.e., the shortening of the channel open time was more pronounced at more negative potentials. The plot of the reciprocal of mean channel open time versus bupivacaine concentration was linear. Similar effects were observed when bupivacaine was added to the bathing medium in both cell-attached and inside-out patch conditions, but in this case the onset of the drug action occurred at a later time and its potency was lower. Application of bupivacaine methiodide via the bathing medium after the establishment of the gigaohm seals, however, had no effect on the kinetics of ACh-activated single channels under both patch conditions (cell-attached and inside-out). The patch-clamp results indicated that the charged form of bupivacaine blocks the open state of ACh-activated ionic channels interacting with sites at the extracellular segment of the ACh receptor-ionic channel complex and creating a species with little or no conductance. A sequential model can be used to explain the interactions of these noncompetitive antagonists of the ACh receptor-ionic channel complex with the open channel. This interpretation of the action of bupivacaine and its quaternary analogue as open channel blockers also was reached based on an analysis of macroscopic events in nicotinic synapses of frog muscle."}

Gemcitabine is currently the best known chemotherapeutic option available for pancreatic cancer, but the tumor returns de novo with acquired resistance over time, which becomes a major issue for all gemcitabine-related chemotherapies. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that dihydroartemisinin (DHA) enhances gemcitabine-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cell lines in vitro. The mechanism is at least partially due to DHA deactivates gemcitabine-induced NF-kappaB activation, so as to decrease tremendously the expression of its target gene products, such as c-myc, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL. In our in vivo studies, gemcibabine also manifested remarkably enhanced anti-tumor effect when combined with DHA, as manifested by significantly increased apoptosis, as well as decreased Ki-67 index, NF-kappaB activity and its related gene products, and predictably, significantly reduced tumor volume. We concluded that inhibition of gemcitabine-induced NF-kappaB activation is one of the mechanisms that DHA dramatically promotes its anti-tumor effect on pancreatic cancer."}

These were the albino ICR, the inbred BALB/C, C57BL/6 and the hybrid CDF-I mice. Amantadine produced a strain-dependent behavioral stimulation subsequent the fourth dose. This was apparent in ICR and C57BL/6 mouse strains and was followed by a behavioral depression phase occurring during the night in C57BL/6 mice which was antagonized by chlorpromazine. Administration of chlorpromazine alone affected only CDF-1 mouse mobility. Chlorpromazine reduced only ICR mouse brain dopamine without concomitant changes in major acid metabolites. Repeated administration of amantadine prior to chlorpromazine negated this effect. Chlorpromazine enhancement of BALB/C brain serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was antagonised by pretreatment with amantadine. This antagonism was also evident in BALB/C mouse brain dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. The results suggest genotypic-dependent behavioral and cerebral effects by the drugs studied. The antagonism between amantadine and chlorpromazine on brain amines may explain the therapeutic efficacy of amantadine in modulating chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal disorders."}

The patient received passive immunotherapy with lymphokine-activated killer cells concomitantly. Two HLA-A24-positive patients with PMME were treated. Both patients initially received radical esophagectomy with regional lymphadenectomy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with dacarbazine, nimustine, vincristine and interferon-alpha. In the case 1 patient, active specific immunotherapy was used to treat a large abdominal lymph node metastasis that became obvious 21 months after surgery. The disease remained stable for 5 months, and the patient survived for 12 months after the initiation of immunotherapy. In the case 2 patient, immunotherapy was tried as post-operative adjuvant treatment after adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no tumor recurrence for 16 months after the immunotherapy. As of 49 months after esophagectomy, the patient is still alive. In both patients, the ability of peripheral lymphocytes to produce IFN-gamma in vitro in response to peptide stimulation was significantly enhanced and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test response to MAGE-3 peptide was turned positive after immunotherapy. In conclusion, active specific immunotherapy for PMME with the use of DCs and MAGE peptides was safe and capable of inducing peptide-specific immune responses.

We have used the stimulation of the specific activity of the \"estrogen induced protein\", creatine kinase BB, as a response marker in bone, cartilage, uterine and adipose cells and in rat skeletal tissues, uterus and mesometrial adipose tissue. In vitro, TMI, tamoxifen and raloxifene mimicked the agonistic action of 17beta-estradiol in ROS 17/2.8 rat osteogenic osteosarcoma, female calvaria, and SaOS2 human osteoblast cells. In Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, tamoxifen showed reduced agonistic effects and raloxifene showed no stimulation. However, as antagonists, tamoxifen and raloxifene were equally effective in Ishikawa or SaOS2 cells. In immature rats, all four of the antiestrogens inhibited estrogen action in diaphysis, epiphysis, uterus and mesometrial adipose tissue; when administered alone, tamoxifen stimulated creatine kinase (CK) specific activity in all these tissues. Raloxifene and TMI, however, stimulated only the skeletal tissues and had no stimulatory effect in the uterus or mesometrial fat, and the pure antiestrogen ICI 164,384 showed no stimulatory effect in any of the tissues. The simultaneous injection of estrogen, plus an antiestrogen which acted as an agonist, resulted in lower CK activity than after injection of either agent alone. These differential effects, in vivo and in vitro, may point the way to a wider therapeutic choice of an appropriate antiestrogen which, although antagonizing E2 action in mammary cancer, can still protect against osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease and not stimulate the uterus with its attendant undesirable changes, or interfere with the beneficial action of E2 in the brain."}

Lenalidomide is an antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory agent with broad antitumor activity. We hypothesized that the modulation of the cellular immune response to apoptosis caused by ketoconazole may be increased with the addition of lenalidomide. Methods This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ketoconazole and lenalidomide in patients with CRPC. Treatment schema included standard ketoconazole 400\u00a0mg orally three times daily plus hydrocortisone orally (20\u00a0mg in the morning and 10\u00a0mg at night) in combination with lenalidomide 25\u00a0mg orally daily for 21\u00a0days in a 28-day\u00a0cycle and aspirin 75\u00a0mg daily. The primary endpoint of this study was response (either by \u2265 50% PSA decline or objective disease assessed by RECIST v1.0). Exploratory endpoints included changes in T cell, dendritic cell (DC) marker counts, and their correlation with PSA response to treatment. Results A total of 34 CRPC patients, median age 69\u00a0years, 76% ECOG 0 and 76% with metastases participated in the study. Patients received a median of 2\u00a0cycles (range 1-35); nine patients (26%) received >10\u00a0cycles of treatment. PSA responses were observed in 17 patients (50%) with 11 patients (32%) achieving a PSA decline of >90%. Among the 9 patients with measurable disease, 2 patients (22%) had PR and 2 other (22%) had SD as best response. Median time to failure (TTF) was 2.7\u00a0months (range 0.2-32.8); and 8 patients were treated for \u2265 15\u00a0months. Most common adverse events included fatigue (76%), skin reactions (62%), lymphopenia (44%) and anemia (44%). One possible treatment-related death was noted. For 16 patients with available serial correlative data, there was a significant increase in the dendritic cells subsets BDCA-1 (+146.7, -20.1 to +501.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.018) and BDCA-3 (39.8%, -100 to 282.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.001) after 8\u00a0weeks of treatment. No association between immune cell counts and PSA response at 8\u00a0weeks was observed. Conclusion The combination of ketoconazole and lenalidomide was well tolerated but did not meet the primary endpoint of response, despite durable responses were observed in a selected group of patients. Although ketoconazole has now been replaced with more active novel agents, the combination of novel CYP-17 inhibitors with agents capable of modulating the immune system warrants further prospective investigation.

The present study attempted to explore the efficacy of curcumin and resveratrol in modulating premature mitochondria senescence and ultrastructural changes during lung carcinogenesis. The mice were segregated into 5 groups, which included normal control, benzo[a]pyrene (BP) treated, BP + curcumin (C) treated, BP + resveratrol (R) treated, and BP + C + R treated groups. Animals were given a single ip injection of benzo[a]pyrene in corn oil at a dose level of 100 mg/kg body weight. Treatments of curcumin and resveratrol were given orally in drinking water at a dose level of 60 mg/kg body weight and 5.7 \u00b5g/mL drinking water, respectively, 3 times a week for a total duration of 22 weeks. Ultrastructure of BP-treated mice revealed disruptions in cellular integrity along with nuclear deformation and premature mitochondrial senescence. Interestingly, supplementation of curcumin and resveratrol individually resulted in improvement of ultrahistoarchitecture of BP-treated mice but the improvement was much greater with combined supplementation of phytochemicals. Further, benzo[a]pyrene treatment revealed alterations in lung histoarchitecture, which, however, was improved appreciably following combined supplementation with curcumin and resveratrol. The present study concludes that combined supplementation with curcumin and resveratrol effectively modulates histoarchitecture as well as ultrahistoarchitecture during benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung carcinogenesis in mice. Cancer is a public health problem worldwide. Lung cancer is a major cause of mortality throughout the world and is responsible for the deaths of more than one million people annually. Phytochemicals have shown great potential in preventing the occurrence of cancer and other chronic diseases that result from oxidative stress induced by free radicals. Phytochemicals are nonnutritive products of plants and, being nontoxic, are presently being studied the world over for their chemopreventive actions in controlling various diseases, including cancer. In the present study, curcumin and resveratrol are the phytochemicals of interest. Curcumin, a polyphenol, has been reported to have anti-invasive properties. Further, curcumin has been shown to activate apoptotic machinery in patients with lung cancer. On the other hand, resveratrol (trans-3,4,5- thihydroxystibene) is a phytoalexin that is present naturally in grapes as well as in a variety of medicinal plants and has been shown to exhibit antioxidant activity with a potential to induce apoptosis."}

Patients with metastatic solid tumors received sunitinib (37.5 mg/d, 4 wk on/2 wk off) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously every 2 wk). Responses were assessed every 2 cycles. Serum levels of angiogenic molecules were measured using ELISA assays. Twenty-two patients were enrolled, including 11 melanoma, 5 renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 5 adrenal cancer, and 1 angiosarcoma. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed in 15 patients, including hypertension (41%), thrombocytopenia (23%), and fatigue (14%). Three RCC patients, and 1 melanoma patient developed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Partial response (PR) occurred in 21% patients, including melanoma (2), adrenal (1), and renal (1) carcinomas. Overall, 6 patients demonstrated some reduction in their tumor burden. Serum VEGF and several other proangiogenic proteins declined over the first 4 wk of treatment whereas the putative VEGF-resistant protein, prokineticin-2, increased over 10-fold. Occurrence of TMA related to dual VEGF/VEGFR inhibition can result from systemic or nephron specific injury even in non-renal malignancies. While the combination of sunitinib and bevacizumab was clinically efficacious in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, the observance of microangiopathy, even in non-RCC patients, is a significant toxicity that precludes further clinical development.

Age is the greatest risk factor for cancer; therefore, this demographic shift is a main reason for an increase of cancer incidence. Lung cancer is a typical disease of the elderly patients. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 20% of all lung cancer cases. This review summarises the issues of treatment of SCLC in elderly. The number of randomised phase III trials concerning treatment of SCLC in elderly patients are very limited. Although currently most treatment decisions are based on lower grades of evidence, some conclusions can be drawn from the current studies. Age alone is a very uncertain prognostic criteria for outcome or tolerability of treatment. Much more important is the geriatric assessment of each individual patient. Current treatment standards for limited disease (LD)-SCLC (polychemotherapy plus local thoracic irradiation and additional prophylactic cranial irradiation in case of complete remission) seems to be also feasible for 'fit' elderly (>70 years) LD-SCLC patients with a good performance and full functional capacities. There are preliminary data indicating that a similar outcome in elderly patients can probably be achieved a with reduced number of treatment schedules (e.g. 2 instead of 4 cycles in combination with radiotherapy. Surgical resection is also feasible in selected elderly patients with very early stage SCLC, where this maybe an appropriate approach, although no phase III data are available, which demonstrated the benefit of additional surgery compared to chemotherapy alone in early stage SCLC. In patients with extensive disease-SCLC age alone does not necessarily restrict the use of multiagent regimen, although the risk of haematological toxicity seems to be higher than in the younger patients. When standard treatment is not feasible due to co-morbidity or loss of functional capacity, several alternative combination regimens are available, which appear to be slightly superior to single agent treatment, although randomised data for elderly on that issue are sparse. Carboplatin and etoposide seems currently the most appropriate two-drug combination in elderly patients, but there are a variety of active and low toxic third generation agents like taxanes, gemcitabine and vinorelbine which are active in both, non-small cell lung cancer and SCLC. For the comparison of trials in elderly patients it will be of key importance to include a comprehensive and standardised geriatric assessment in such studies."}

The outcomes for patients with previously treated advanced stage non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) are very poor, with a modest benefit from chemotherapy over best supportive care.

Although only a subset of patients benefit from these drugs, the treatment is usually well tolerated and the responses are often durable, with an unprecedented number of survivors 3 years after starting the therapy.

However, \u03b21-selective blockers are the most commonly used \u03b2-blockers in hypertension. Here the author tested the hypothesis that \u03b21AR may function as presynaptic, release-facilitating auto-receptors. Since \u03b21AR-blockers are injected during myocardial infarction, their influence on the cardiovascular response to acute norepinephrine release was also studied. By a newly established method, using tyramine-stimulated release through the norepinephrine transporter (NET), presynaptic control of catecholamine release was studied in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. \u03b21AR-selective antagonists (CGP20712A, atenolol, metoprolol) reduced norepinephrine overflow to plasma equally efficient as \u03b22AR-selective (ICI-118551) and \u03b21+2AR (nadolol) antagonists in both strains. Neither antagonist lowered epinephrine secretion. Atenolol, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, reduced norepinephrine overflow after adrenalectomy (AdrX), AdrX\u2009+\u2009ganglion blockade, losartan, or nephrectomy. Atenolol and metoprolol reduced resting cardiac work load. During tyramine-stimulated norepinephrine release, they had little effect on work load, and increased the transient rise in total peripheral vascular resistance, particularly atenolol when combined with losartan. In conclusion, \u03b21AR, like \u03b22AR, stimulated norepinephrine but not epinephrine release, independent of adrenal catecholamines, ganglion transmission, or renal renin release/angiotensin AT1 receptor activation. \u03b21AR therefore functioned as a peripheral, presynaptic, facilitating auto-receptor. Like tyramine, hypoxia may induce NET-mediated release. Augmented tyramine-induced vasoconstriction, as observed after injection of \u03b21AR-blocker, particularly atenolol combined with losartan, may hamper organ perfusion, and may have clinical relevance in hypoxic conditions such as myocardial infarction.

In addition to inhibition of bone remodelling, an anti-angiogenetic effect has become the focus of research. The aim of these study was to investigate the effect of different bisphosphonates on human umbilicord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), which play an important role in angiogenesis. Using varying concentrations, the impact of one non-nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (clodronate) and three nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (ibandronate, pamidronate and zoledronate) on HUVEC and EPC was analysed. The biologic behaviour of HUVEC after incubation with different bisphosphonates was measured in a Boyden migration assay as well as in a 3D angiogenesis assay. The number of apoptotic cells was measured by Tunnel assay. To underline the importance of neoangiogenesis in the context of BP-ONJ, we measured the EPC number after incubation with different bisphosphonates in vitro. HUVEC and EPC were significantly influenced by bisphosphonates at different concentrations compared with the non-treated control groups. The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates pamidronate and zoledronate had the greatest impact on the cells, whereas clodronate followed by ibandronate was less distinct on cell function. These results underline the hypothesis that inhibited angiogenesis induced by bisphosphonates might be of relevance in the development and maintenance of BP-ONJ. The increased impact by highly potent bisphosphonates on HUVEC and EPC may explain the high prevalence of BP-ONJ in patients undergoing this treatment."}

Sandostatin therapy improved the arginine-8-vasopressin reaction, suppressed the basal levels of corticotropin and cortisol with the maintenance of cortisol stimulability; the peak-reaction of corticotropin became normal in two patients, however, with a shortened duration of response. Diuresis of the patients increased under the treatment. Sandostatin markedly alleviated the clinical symptoms and suppressed the growth hormone secretion, but did not influence the size of the pituitary adenomas.

In attempts to enhance antisense therapy, recent reports describe how two of the binding sites mentioned above can be sequentially placed within a single complementary (bispecific) strand and administered either in the presence or absence of additional therapeutic agents. When tested against breast and prostate tumor cell lines specific differences were noted: MCF-7 breast cancer cells were more receptive to the inhibitory effects of monospecific oligos, whereas PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cells were particularly responsive to bispecifics. In an effort to identify agents which enhance the activity of oligos and which possess less toxicity than traditionally employed chemotherapeutics, Rapamycin, an immunosuppressive agent known to regulate tumor growth and signal transduction mediated by the mTOR receptor, is compared to paclitaxel in combination therapy employing monospecific or bispecific oligos. Bispecifics were constructed recognizing the binding sites for TGF-alpha and EGFR mRNA [TGF-alpha/EGFR (MR(12)) and EGFR/TGF-alpha (MR(21))]; another pair recognized binding sites for EGFR and bcl-2 [EGFR/bcl-2 (MR(24)) and bcl-2/EGFR (MR(42))]; while a third pair employed only against the LNCaP prostate cell line recognized bcl-2 and the androgen receptor [bcl-2/AR (MR4(45)) and AR/bcl-2 (MR(54))]. Oligo pairs differ in their 5'-3' linear binding site orientations, and were tested in vitro against MCF-7 breast and PC-3 and LNCaP prostate tumor cell lines.

Five experiments evaluated the effect of monospecific or bispecific antisense oligos in combination with an LD(50) dosage of either Rapamycin or paclitaxel and led to the conclusion that although these agents act via different mechanisms, they are comparable in effectiveness."}

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) L861Q mutation is a non-classical mutation, with a low incidence, poor response, and uncertain resistance mechanisms when treated by an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). The liver is one of the most common distant organs to metastasize in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and achieving complete remission treatment for the liver is difficult. In this report, a patient was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring the EGFR L861Q mutation and responded well to afatinib for 16 months. Complete response and partial response (PR) appeared in the liver metastasis and primary lesion respectively. Following this, afatinib plus crizotinib overcame the acquired resistance of MET amplification and brought about the complete remission of the liver for 10 months. Interestingly, the liver remission endured for 22 months and persisted even when the disease progressed and the EGFR T790M mutation emerged. To our knowledge, this is the first time that afatinib induced longterm liver remission in a patient with an EGFR non-classical mutation, and in whom crizotinib with afatinib proved to be a reliable treatment for overcoming MET amplification resistance with an EGFR non-classical mutation. This precise and individualized gene-based treatment significantly prolonged the survival time of this stage IV case with brain metastases yielding 26 months of progression-free survival (PFS) time and more than 3 years of overall survival time."}

However, postpartum blood loss is known to be greater with precipitate labour and labours induced with oxytocin and prostaglandins, unless an oxytocic agent is continued after delivery. A retrospective study was undertaken at the University Hospital of the West Indies to look at the outcome of induced labour during 3 months, October-December 1998. Misoprostol induction was compared to the outcome after oxytocin induction, misoprostol induction plus oxytocin augmentation and those patients who delivered without oxytocics during this same time period. During that period, 524 patients were delivered and 51 (9.7%) were induced with misoprostol, 174 (33.2%) with oxytocin, 21 (4%) misoprostol plus oxytocin and 271 (51.7%) without oxytocic. Seven patients were eliminated from further analysis, as we were unsure of their induction status. Results showed no significant differences between the groups for variables such as maternal age, parity and fetal birth weight. There was a significantly greater mean blood loss at delivery with all induced labour compared with those not induced. For misoprostol 162.5(SD 190) ml, oxytocin (150 (SD 100) ml and for oxytocin plus misoprostol 150 (SD 150) ml, while controls had the lowest mean blood loss 100 (SD 130) ml occurring where no predelivery oxytocic was needed (P<0.03). Postpartum haemorrhage was highest with misoprostol 5.8% versus 4.4% for no oxytocic, 1.1% for oxytocin and 0% for misoprostol plus oxytocin.

Although chemotherapy costs have not been highlighted traditionally, there is increasing pressure to demonstrate the value of new treatments within the health care budget. Pharmaceutical companies are assessing the economic value of their products before launch. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue developed for use in solid tumours. The purpose of this model was to investigate the clinical outcomes and potential cost savings for gemcitabine used as monotherapy compared to cisplatin and etoposide combination therapy in late stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in a palliative (as opposed to aggressive) chemotherapy setting. Gemcitabine treatment data were taken from a large NSCLC study and data from retrospective chart reviews identified through the National Oncology Data Base. The model population and effectiveness of the two regimens were judged to be similar, except for baseline performance status. If drug costs were not included, the probability distribution resulting from the simulation showed median cost savings per cycle ranging from $US 1504 to $US 7425, with a medium value of $US 2154. The model suggested that gemcitabine would result in cost savings per cycle more than 90% of the time. Outpatient versus inpatient drug administrations accounted for the majority of potential cost savings. Most of the remaining cost savings were attributable to the difference in febrile neutropenia and antiemetic use. This economic model showed susbstantial savings if gemcitabine was used instead of cisplatin and etoposide combination therapy in the United States' community care setting. Some savings would be realized even if the location of treatment for both regimens was mostly outpatient. Assessment of the product's economic value before launch has assisted in our understanding of the potential areas of cost savings for gemcitabine and has guided us in the design of prospective randomized studies which included pharmacoeconomic endpoints."}

A therapeutic trough level of tacrolimus was reached 6 weeks after complete relief of diarrhea. Tacrolimus shows large variability in bioavailability after oral administration, both due to intestinal metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) and active secretion from enterocyte into intestinal lumen by P-glycoprotein. The epithelial cells of the intestine, may be destroyed abrogating P-glycoproteins during the course of enterocolitis, thereby increasing the levels of tacrolimus. It is recommended to monitor trough levels of tacrolimus during severe diarrhea of any nature to prevent tacrolimus-related complications."}

We evaluated the effect of combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) plus zalcitabine (ddC) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients who had not previously received antiretroviral treatment ('naive' patients). The immunological and virological parameters evaluated were CD4 cell count, syncytium-inducing (SI) viral phenotype and plasma HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (HIV viral load). A total of 75 patients entered the study, with CD4 cell counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3. All received zidovudine (200 mg) plus zalcitabine (0.75 mg) three times daily for 24 weeks. Treatment was well tolerated. However, four patients presented with anaemia (haemoglobin < 10.0 g/dl) and one patient had both anaemia and neutropenia (0.8 x 10(9) neutrophils/l). Combination therapy with zidovudine plus zalcitabine resulted in a pronounced improvement of virological and immunological markers. Approximately 25% of patients achieved undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels (< 200 copies/ml) at week 24. At the end of the study (24 weeks) a significant reduction (> 0.5 log) of plasma HIV RNA was observed in approximately 70% of patients and in 50% an even greater decrease (> 1 log) was achieved. The most significant decrease in mean plasma HIV RNA levels was observed at week 4, whereas the highest increase in CD4 cell count was found at week 24. Approximately 80% of patients who showed baseline plasma HIV RNA levels below 20000 copies/ml had less than 5000 copies/ml at week 24. The plasma HIV RNA reduction observed at week 4 was significantly maintained at week 24. Therefore, we can rapidly select those who will not respond to therapy and adjust the treatment after a short interval. Our study supports the idea of early therapy because all patients who reached undetectable levels of plasma HIV RNA at week 24 had at baseline a median plasma HIV RNA load of 2560 copies/ml. In conclusion, zidovudine in combination with zalcitabine was well tolerated in the  majority of patients and led to a significant reduction in plasma HIV RNA copies in most of the patients with initial viraemia lower than 20000 copies/ml."}

Incomplete protection against ischemic events can be attributed to the fact that these therapies each target a single platelet activation pathway, allowing continued platelet activation via other pathways, including the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) pathway stimulated by thrombin. Increased bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy can be attributed to blockade of the thromboxane A(2) (by aspirin) and adenosine diphosphate (by P2Y(12) antagonist) platelet activation pathways that are essential to hemostasis. The second-generation P2Y(12) inhibitor ticagrelor plus aspirin demonstrated superior ischemic outcomes, including reduction in total mortality, versus clopidogrel plus aspirin, but event rates remain high, and major bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass grafting is increased. The novel P2Y(12) antagonist elinogrel, available in intravenous and oral formulations, may have a more favorable benefit-to-risk profile than existing agents in this class because of reversible and competitive binding to the P2Y(12) receptor. Inhibition of PAR-1 is an attractive, novel approach in antiplatelet therapy because it may provide incremental ischemic protection without increasing bleeding. The PAR-1 antagonist vorapaxar (SCH 530348) has been associated with favorable efficacy and safety in phase 2 trials. Two phase 3 trials are evaluating the efficacy and safety of vorapaxar in patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes and in patients with documented atherothrombotic disease."}

We believe that oral administration could be a useful alternative to the parenteral route. In the second trial, 222 evaluable patients received 20 mg/day of tamoxifen (Nolvadex) for 1 year (arm A), or the same dose of tamoxifen plus UFT 400 mg/day for 6 months. All patients were postmenopausal, and the characteristics of the tumors were the same as those in patients in the first trial. In arm A there were 109 patients and in arm B, 113. The groups were well balanced. The overall survival and the disease-free survival rates were equal in both arms, but were longer in arm B in the subset of patients with five or more axillary-involved nodes.

Patients with stable or progressive malignant primary glioma received erlotinib alone or combined with temozolomide in this dose-escalation study. In each treatment group, patients were stratified by coadministration of EIAEDs. Erlotinib was started at 100 mg orally once daily as a 28-day treatment cycle, with dose escalation by 50 mg/day up to 500 mg/day. Temozolomide was administered at 150 mg/m2 for five consecutive days every 28 days, with dose escalation up to 200 mg/m2 at the second cycle. Eightythree patients were evaluated. Rash, fatigue, and diarrhea were the most common adverse events and were generally mild to moderate. The recommended phase 2 dose of erlotinib is 200 mg/day for patients with glioblastoma multiforme who are not receiving an EIAED, 450 mg/day for those receiving temozolomide plus erlotinib with an EIAED, and at least 500 mg/day for those receiving erlotinib alone with an EIAED. Of the 57 patients evaluable for response, eight had a partial response (PR). Six of the 57 patients had a progression-free survival of longer than six months, including four patients with a PR. Coadministration of EIAEDs reduced exposure to erlotinib as compared with administration of erlotinib alone (33%-71% reduction). There was a modest pharmacokinetic interaction between erlotinib and temozolomide. The favorable tolerability profile and evidence of antitumor activity indicate that further investigation of erlotinib is warranted."}

Difficulty in establishing validated biomarkers has delayed the start of CRC chemoprevention development. Chemoprevention trials for CRC have only recently been initiated thanks to the identification of reliable biomarkers, such as colorectal adenomas and aberrant crypt foci. Some promising agents have been developed for the prevention of CRC. The chemopreventive effect of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors has been shown, although these inhibitors are associated with cardiovascular toxicity as a crucial adverse effect. Aspirin, which is a unique agent among non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) showing minimal gastrointestinal toxicity and no cardiovascular risk, has prevented adenoma recurrence in some randomized controlled trials. More recently, metformin, which is a first-line oral medicine for type 2 diabetes, has been shown to be safe and to prevent adenoma recurrence. A recommendation of the United States Preventive Services Task Force published in 2016 provides a Grade B recommendation for the use of aspirin for chronic prophylaxis against diseases, including CRC, in certain select populations. However, the roles of other agents have yet to be determined, and investigations to identify novel \"post-aspirin\" agents are also needed. The combined use of multiple drugs, such as aspirin and metformin, is another option that may lead not only to stronger CRC prevention, but also to improvement of other obesity-related diseases."}

Infusions of digoxin alone (0.013 mg/min) and in combination with quinidine (0.051 mg/min) demonstrated that quinidine pretreatment significantly decreases the time of onset of arrhythmias and death in these animals as compared with digoxin alone. Similarly, when administered as a slow, bolus intravenous (i.v.) injection to either anesthetized or unanesthetized minipigs, quinidine pretreatment (10 mg/kg, i.v.) led to the rapid development of arrhythmias and death. Quinidine administration in both species also causes a dramatic reduction in blood pressure, and it appears that this hypotension may trigger the irregular rhythms of the heart once digoxin is administered. Electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence showed that the toxicity associated with digoxin administration alone was characterized by bradyarrhythmias and death was attributed to cardiac arrest. In contrast, quinidine pretreatment led to severe tachyarrhythmias and earlier death by ventricular fibrillation. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of these two species, particularly the minipigs, in assessing the magnitude of this drug interaction and also confirm the risks involved when these two drugs are combined."}

We prepared polymeric bilayer vesicles (polymersomes), and actively encapsulated the drug combination by the pH gradient method. A redox-sensitive polymer (PEG-S-S-PLA) was incorporated to sensitize the formulation to reducing agent concentration. Acridine orange (AO) was conjugated to the surface of the polymersomes imparting nuclear localizing property. The polymersomes' toxicity and efficacy were compared with those of a free drug combination using monolayer and three-dimensional spheroid cultures of pancreatic cancer cells.

The data supporting the benefits of sequential endocrine therapy are more certain, and if anastrozole does become the adjuvant agent of choice, the optimal sequence of endocrine agents will need to be identified for use after recurrence on anastrozole for early disease. It will be important that new endocrine options, such as the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant ('Faslodex'), are suitably incorporated into these sequences. Developments such as the sequential use of endocrine therapies in the management of breast cancer have stimulated evolving concepts in our understanding of the basic cell biology of the disease. This has emphasized the importance of understanding the interactions between the different cell-signaling pathways that underlie the development of endocrine resistance. This will present a range of new opportunities for therapeutic intervention and will provide the foundation for the rational design of clinical trials. The resulting incorporation of more target-oriented approaches and newer endocrine agents into the treatment of breast cancer should stimulate the development of promising treatment paradigms and will ultimately provide further benefit to patients."}

Ampicillin was introduced in 1962 in oral and parenteral forms as the first of the semisynthetic penicillins to provide increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Amoxicillin replaced oral ampicillin beginning in 1974 because amoxicillin resulted in higher and more prolonged serum concentrations than did equivalent doses of ampicillin. Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) was introduced in the United States in 1984 to enhance the activity of amoxicillin by addition of the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid. During the past 20 years, amoxicillin/clavulanate has proven effective for a variety of pediatric infectious diseases, particularly acute otitis media (AOM). In 2001, a new pediatric formulation, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES-600) was approved for use in the United States. The high dose preparation addressed the needs of pediatricians by providing greater amounts of amoxicillin while maintaining the same daily dose of clavulanic acid as the regular strength formulation. Doubling the dose of amoxicillin for management of recurrent and persistent AOM was recommended in 1999 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of concern about the increased incidence of nonsusceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The original formulation combined amoxicillin/clavulanate in a 4:1 ratio and was followed by a 7:1 ratio formulation. The high dose formulation (600 mg of amoxicillin per 5 ml) provides a 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate. Although management of AOM will likely undergo changes in the coming years, amoxicillin is expected to remain first line therapy for AOM. For children who fail initial therapy with amoxicillin, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate, an oral cephalosporin or parenteral ceftriaxone is recommended."}

The risk of developing TEE appears to be particularly high when these immunomodulatory agents are combined with anthracyclines as treatment of newly-diagnosed disease. Up-front combinations including thalidomide plus pulse dexamethasone and/or alkylating agents are associated with an intermediate risk, whereas the same regimens for relapsed/refractory myeloma seem to be associated with the lowest risk. Several different thromboprophylaxis strategies have been effective in lowering the risk of developing clots: daily aspirin (81-325 mg/day), full-intensity warfarin (INR 2-3), and prophylactic enoxaparin (40 mg SQ daily). Low, fixed-dose warfarin may also reduce the risk of TEE, but the data on this are disputable.

A total of 24 patients were entered into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 48-75). ECOG performance status was 0 in ten, 1 in 11 patients and 2 in three patients. Locoregional disease alone was present in seven patients. The remainder had one or more sites of metastases. The actual dose administered to the 24 patients was as follows. The six patients in group 1 all completed six courses of treatment as per protocol. In group 2, three patients completed six courses, two stopped because of toxicity after one and four courses and one had progressive disease after one course. In group 3, three patients completed and three stopped early because of progressive disease. In group 4, two patients completed, one progressed after four courses and three responding patients stopped treatment because of toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose of mitozantrone in the 3M combination was 12 mg m-2. The use of filgrastim with increasing doses of chemotherapy prevents neutropenia, but other toxicities, namely thrombocytopenia and lethargy, then become dose limiting."}

Melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects on isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. The present study sought to determine if melatonin confers its beneficial effects by acting on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and attenuates the neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of aged mice. A total of 72 male C57BL/6 mice, 16-month-old, were randomly and equally divided into six groups: (1) the control group (CON); (2) the rapamycin group (RAP); (3) the melatonin group (MEL); (4) the isoflurane group (ISO); (5) the rapamycin + isoflurane group (RAP + ISO); and (6) the melatonin + isoflurane group (MEL + ISO). RAP, RAP + ISO, MEL, MEL + ISO groups received 1 mg/kg/day mTOR inhibitor rapamycin solution or 10 mg/kg/day melatonin solution, respectively, intraperitoneally at 5:00 p.m. for 14 days consecutively. Mice in the CON and ISO groups were administered an equivalent volume of saline. Subsequently, ISO, RAP + ISO, and MEL + ISO groups were exposed to inhale 2% isoflurane for 4 h; the CON, RAP, and MEL mice received only the vehicle gas. Then, the memory function and spatial learning of the mice were examined via the Morris water maze (MWM) test. mTOR expression was detected via Western blot, whereas the concentration of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 and that of melatonin was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Melatonin and rapamycin significantly ameliorated the isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and also led to a decrease in the melatonin levels as well as the expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and p-mTOR in the hippocampus. In conclusion, these results showed that melatonin and rapamycin attenuates mTOR expression while affecting the downstream proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, these molecular findings could be associated with an improved cognitive function in mice exposed to isoflurane."}

After all patients were given captopril 50 mg twice daily plus placebo for four weeks, they were randomly assigned into groups receiving in addition either placebo or isradipine 1.25 mg twice daily in increasing doses at four-week intervals. During Weeks 20 to 24, the captopril plus placebo group was given hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg per day. Blood pressure was measured in the morning, 12 hours after tablet intake. Supine blood pressure was reduced in the captopril plus isradipine group by -8/-6, -14/-9, -16/-8, and -11/-7 mm Hg compared with the placebo group.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the toxicity of CHOP combined with amifostine in elderly patients with aggressive NHL. A prospective phase II study was performed in patients aged 60 years and older. Patients with stage I/II disease received 4 cycles of CHOP followed by involved-field irradiation. Patients with stage III/IV received 6-8 cycles of CHOP. Amifostine (740 mg/m(2)) was administered as a 15-min i.v. infusion immediately before chemotherapy. Forty-one (median age 69.5 years, range 60-87) of 49 consecutive previously untreated patients, aged 60 years and older, with aggressive NHL seen in our center were included in the study. Twenty-one patients had stage I/II disease and 20 had stage III/IV disease. The patients received a total of 207 cycles of amifostine-CHOP. Infusion of amifostine caused mild to moderate transient side effects, including a drop of systolic blood pressure >20 mmHg in 54 cycles and nausea/vomiting in 36 cycles. Hematotoxicity of CHOP consisted of leukopenia grade 4 in only 15.4% of cycles. There were two cases of grade 3 anemia. No thrombocytopenia higher than grade 2 occurred. Febrile neutropenia was rare, occurring in 4.3% of cycles. One patient died after the first CHOP administration because of anthracycline-related acute cardiomyopathy (corresponding to a toxic death rate of 2.4%). The complete response rates were 85 and 75% in stage I/II and stage III/IV patients, respectively. After median follow-up of 33 months (range 17-50 months) the median overall survival was not reached in patients with stage I/II and was found to be 32 months in patients with stage III/IV. At 2 years, 76% of patients with stage I/II and 70% with stage III/IV were alive. Twelve of the 15 patients who died were aged older than 70. Amifostine pre-treatment was associated with a low toxicity of CHOP in elderly patients with aggressive NHL treated with curative intent. Treatment outcomes appeared not to be impaired by the addition of amifostine to CHOP. This schedule merits further testing in a randomized trial."}

The aim of this study is to determine the protective effects of erdosteine on CsA-induced heart injury through tissue oxidant/antioxidant parameters and light microscopic evaluation in rats. CsA cardiotoxicity was induced by administrating an oral dose of 15mg/kg CsA daily for 21 days. The rats were divided into four groups: control group (n=4), CsA administrated group (15mg/kg, n=5), CsA+erdosteine administrated group (10mg/kg day orally erdosteine, n=4) and only erdosteine administrated group (10mg/kg day orally n=5). CsA treated rats showed increase in the number of infiltrated cells and disorganization of myocardial fibers with interstitial fibrosis. The number of infiltrated cells, disorganization of myocardial fibers and interstitial fibrosis was diminished in the hearts of CsA-treated rats given erdosteine. The malondialdehyde, the protein carbonyl content and nitric oxide levels were increased in the cyclosporine A group in comparison with the control and CsA plus erdosteine groups. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were higher in CsA plus erdosteine group than CsA group.

A 48-year-old woman was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2002. Following surgery, six cycles of adjuvant FE100C plus irradiation and, subsequently for 1 year, trastuzumab were given. As a result of disseminated metastatic spread in October 2005, the patient received whole-brain radiotherapy for symptomatic central nervous system involvement, and was put on several trastuzumab-based combination regimens (capecitabine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel). In June 2006, the patient developed clinical signs of terminal cone involvement with overflow incontinence and paraparesis of the legs. Immediate radiation led to partial relief from clinical symptoms. Subsequently, the patient was put on the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib and capecitabine (August to October 2007), but on November 6th the patient suffered again from overflow incontinence and weakness of the legs. Failing to respond to lapatinib, the patient received gemcitabine/cisplatin and, additionally, was recommenced on intravenous trastuzumab. Owing to progressive leptomeningeal disease, the patient received repeated doses of intrathecal methotrexate and trastuzumab. Within 2 weeks and four intrathecal treatments, cerebrospinal fluid cytology showed the absence of tumor cells. Moreover, a striking clinical improvement with resolution of the paraparesis of the legs and overflow incontinence was observed. This case report gives details regarding the clinical course of a breast cancer patient who received intrathecal trastuzumab and methotrexate via lumbar puncture for meningeal carcinomatosis of HER2-overexpressing MBC."}

This therapy is more effective when combined with strong lipid-lowering drugs, such as atorvastatin. However, conflicting data have been published concerning the effect of atorvastatin on fibrinogen concentration. Therefore, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin compared to simvastatin on fibrinogen concentration and other hemorheological parameters in patients treated by weekly LDL apheresis. Hemorheological parameters were, studied twice in 9 patients (4 female, 5 male, 54.0+/-8.9 years) with coronary artery disease treated by weekly LDL immunoadsorption, once during concomitant simvastatin therapy (40 mg daily) and once during atorvastatin therapy (40 mg daily). Fibrinogen concentration, plasma and blood viscosity at different shear rates, parameters of red cell aggregation at stasis and shear rate 3/s, and erythrocyte filterability were determined 7 days after the last LDL apheresis after each drug had been given for a minimum for 8 weeks. Fibrinogen concentration did not show any statistically significant difference during therapy with atorvastatin (3.09+/-0.36 g/L) compared to simvastatin (3.13+/-0.77 g/L). Plasma and blood viscosity as well as erythrocyte filterability were also unchanged. The increase in red cell aggregation at stasis during atorvastatin treatment (5.82+/-1.00 U versus 4.89+/-0.48 U during simvastatin; p < 0.05) was inversely correlated with a lower high-density liprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration (1.17+/-0.21 mmol/L versus 1.31+/-0.30 mmol/L during simvastatin; p < 0.05). LDL cholesterol showed a strong trend to lower concentrations during atorvastatin (4.14+/-0.61 mmol/L versus 4.56+/-0.66 mmol/L during simvastatin; p = 0.07), despite a reduced plasma volume treated (3,547+/-1,239 ml during atorvastatin versus 3,888+/-1,206 mL during simvastatin; p < 0.05). In conclusion, fibrinogen concentration and other hemorheological parameters were unchanged during atorvastatin compared to simvastatin therapy with the exception of a higher red cell aggregation at stasis.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated that these new drugs can achieve better treatment results than megestrol acetate (Megace) and may replace tamoxifen for the first-line hormonal therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients. In fact, these drugs are now used in many hospitals and clinics for patients with metastatic breast cancer who were previously given tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment. However, the primary concern is whether they can be used as first-line agents for adjuvant treatment of primary breast cancer or are suitable for breast cancer prevention in view of possible adverse side effects. Recently, the Arimidex and Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination trial demonstrated the superiority in terms of disease-free survival of anastrozole over tamoxifen in adjuvant use for postmenopausal patients with Stage I and II primary breast cancer. The results of this report indicate the potential of anastrozole as an alternative drug in the adjuvant setting, although the mean follow-up time is so far only 47 months. Additional data regarding survival resulting from comparative trials of letrozole and tamoxifen and of exemestane and tamoxifen are expected to be available in a few years. However, limited information is available regarding adverse events caused by long-term administration of aromatase inhibitors. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of these new aromatase inhibitors when used for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal patients with breast cancer."}

Peptic ulcer disease is a common complication after organ transplantation, and long-term administration of antiulcer agents is needed in many renal transplant recipients. Although several drug interactions with mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), have been reported, little is known about the interaction between MPA and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The present study investigated the drug interaction between MMF and lansoprazole or rabeprazole and the impact of cytochrome (CYP) 2C19, and multidrug resistance (MDR)1 C3435T polymorphisms on these drug interactions at 1 year after renal transplantation. Retrospectively, 61 recipients were divided into 3 groups: MMF and tacrolimus as combination immunosuppressive therapy, together with either 30 mg lansoprazole (n = 22) or 10 mg rabeprazole (n = 17), or without PPI (n = 22). One year after transplantation, plasma concentrations of MPA were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean dose-unadjusted and -adjusted Cmax of MPA with 30 mg lansoprazole were significantly lower than those without PPI (11.8 vs. 17.8 microg/mL, P = 0.0197, and 22.6 vs. 33.1 ng/mL/mg MMF, P = 0.0222, respectively). In recipients having the CYP2C19 *1/*2+*1/*3 or MDR1 C3435T CC genotype, the mean dose-adjusted AUC0-12 of MPA with 30 mg lansoprazole was significantly smaller than that with 10 mg rabeprazole or without PPI. The plasma concentration of MPA was influenced by 30 mg lansoprazole but not 10 mg rabeprazole. Because of the greater gastric acid secretion-inhibitory effect of 30 mg lansoprazole in recipients having the CYP2C19 *1/*2+*1/*3 (intermediate metabolizer) or MDR1 C3435T CC genotype, the elution and hydrolysis of MMF might be decreased. Although the clinical relevance might be minor, the fact that administration of 30 mg lansoprazole in patients having the CYP2C19 *2 or *3 allele or the MDR1 C3435T CC genotype diminishes the absorption of MPA in the maintenance stage after renal transplantation should be taken into consideration with regard to the MPA pharmacokinetics."}

The COX-2 and EGFR pathways mutually enhance their procarcinogenic effects in different tumor types. Therefore, simultaneous EGFR and COX-2 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We obtained tissue and serum samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to detect the relationship between EGFR mutation and serum COX-2 level. Subsequently, gefitinib was combined with celecoxib to investigate the efficacy of inhibition in vitro in two NSCLC cell lines: HCC827 (del E746-A750) and A549 (wild-type EGFR). The cells were treated with gefitinib or celecoxib alone or with gefitinib plus celecoxib. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed and correlated with expression of COX-2 and phosphorylated (p)-EGFR. The EGFR mutation rate of the high-COX-2 patients was significantly higher than that in the low-COX-2 patients. Multivariate analysis showed that high COX-2 levels were independently associated with EGFR mutation. Celecoxib and gefitinib inhibited cell growth in both cell lines. At sufficiently high concentrations, celecoxib plus gefitinib significantly mutually enhanced their anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in both cell lines. At low concentrations, the combination had no additional effects on A549 cells. There was increased down regulation of COX-2 and p-EGFR when both cell lines were treated with high-concentration celecoxib plus gefitinib compared to either agent alone. This study demonstrates that high serum COX-2 levels may indicate EGFR mutations and that the efficacy of combined celecoxib and gefitinib is significantly greater in NSCLC cells with EGFR mutations; at high concentrations, the combination is efficacious in wild-type NSCLC cells."}

The 3-year overall survival was 72% versus 65% (P=0.03), respectively. The hematologic toxicity was substantial in both arms and substantially higher than observed with the weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin induction regimen. Many patients had treatment delays, dose reductions and stopped treatment prematurely. The JGOG 3016 study is the only dose-dense study with such a significant survival benefit.

No particular risk factor has been clearly identified for ALCL, but a recent study showed an odds ratio of 18 for ALCL associated with breast implants. Usually, the architecture of involved organs is eroded by solid, cohesive sheets of neoplastic cells, with peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma being the main differential diagnoses. In this regard, staining for PAX5 and CD30 is useful. Translocations involving ALK are absent, TCR genes are clonally rearranged. CGH and GEP studies suggest a tendency of ALCL-ALK- to differ both from PTCL-NOS and from ALCL-ALK+. Patients with ALCL-ALK- are usually adults with a median age of 54-61 years, and a male-to-female ratio of 0.9. At presentation, ALCL-ALK- is often in III-IV stage, with B symptoms, high International Prognostic Index score, high lactate dehydrogenase serum levels, and an aggressive course. ALCL-ALK- presents with lymph node involvement in \u223c50% of cases; extranodal spread (20%) is less common. Staging work-up for ALCL-ALK- is similar to that routinely used for nodal NHL. Overall prognosis is poor, with a 5-year OS of 30-49%, which is significantly worse when compared to OS reported in patients with ALCL-ALK+ (5-year: 70-86%). Patients with systemic ALCL exhibit a significantly better survival compared with patients with PTCL-NOS, with a 5-year OS of 51% and 32%, respectively. Age, PIT scoring system, \u03b22-microglobulin, and bone marrow infiltration are the main prognostic factors. The expression of proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis (caspase 3, Bcl-2, PI9) and of CD56 is related to clinical outcome. ALCL-ALK- is generally responsive to doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy, but relapses are frequent. CHOP is the most commonly used regimen to treat systemic ALCL with complete remission rates of 56%, and a 10-year DFS of 28%. Encouraging results have been reported with more intensive chemotherapy regimens. The addition of etoposide improved outcome. Alemtuxumab-CHOP regimen was associated with excellent remission rate but increased toxicity. The role of high-dose chemotherapy supported by ASCT has not been investigated in a trial of exclusively ALCL patients. When used in first remission, it was associated with a 5-year PFS of 64%. High-dose chemotherapy with ASCT is the standard therapeutic option for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. The role of allogeneic transplantation in patients with relapsed/refractory ALCL remains to be defined but there are data to support the contention that a graft-versus-lymphoma effect does exist. Myeloablative conditioning has been associated with 5-year PFS and OS of 40% and 41%, respectively, but a 5-year TRM of 33% was reported. Allo-SCT can be an option for relapsed/refractory ALCL in younger patients, preferably in the setting of a clinical trial. Pralatrexate, anti-CD30 monoclonal antibodies, brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) in particular, (131)I-anti-CD45 radioantibody, yttrium-anti-CD25 radioimmunoconjugates, histone deacetylase inhibitors, bortezomib, gemcitabine, vorinostat, lenalidomide, and their combinations represent the most appealing chemotherapy and/or targeted agents to be investigated in future trials."}

Epinephrine caused by hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. Both actions of epinephrine were partly inhibited by either an alpha or beta blocker and completely abolished by combination of both blockers in normal rats. However, in rats treated with anti-insulin serum or 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, a potent inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, both actions of epinephrine were blocked by propranolol alone, but not by phentolamine. It is concluded that beta-receptor-mediated inhibiton of peripheral glucose utilization is primarily responsible for epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia and impairment of glucose tolerance. Furthermore, the reduction of glycemic action of epinephrine observed after alpha blockade is due to the hypoglycemic action of insulin secreted by the stimulation of beta receptors in pancreatic beta cells."}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hybrid model was developed that incorporates recurrence rates, overall survival, treatment costs and treatment-associated adverse events and the resulting costs. The basic assumption was that generic anastrozole would lead to a price reduction to 75% of the original price. Further analyses were carried out with 50% and 25% of the original prices for anastrozole and letrozole.  RESULTS: The cost-benefit model showed a gain of 0.3124 or 0.0659 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for letrozole or anastrozole. Incremental costs of \u20ac 29,375.15/QALY for letrozole (100% of original price) were calculated and \u20ac 94,648.03/QALY for anastrozole (75% of original price).

In a typical experiment of photosensitization to systemic sulfanilamide, the experimental group had a mean increase in ear thickness of 6.0 X 10(-2) mm 24 h after photochallenge, while unsensitized control animals showed a mean change of -0.8 X 10(-2) mm. The histopathology of the positive challenge reaction was characteristic of a delayed type hypersensitivity. Adoptive transfer of photoallergy to systemic sulfanilamide to naive recipients was accomplished by i.v. injection of lymph node cells (5 X 10(7) harvested from actively photosensitized donors. Clinical reports have suggested that exposure to systemic medications followed by sunlight can induce an eruption having a photoallergic basis. We now report the first experimental proof of that hypothesis. The murine model should facilitate exploration of photoallergic mechanisms and, in addition, it provides the basis for a prospective test of systemic drugs for their photoallergenicity."}

Compilation of data from phase II trials of single-agent docetaxel therapy in NSCLC yielded overall response rates of 26% and a 1-year survival rate of 52%. Furthermore, a recent study that combined radiotherapy with concurrent docetaxel treatment reported an overall response rate of 77%. The most important adverse effect of docetaxel therapy is neutropenia Phase II trials of single-agent irinotecan for NSCLC patients resulted in response rates of 15% to 31%. The main toxicities were neutropenia and diarrhea. Investigators have begun to explore the efficacy of combining docetaxel and irinotecan. The results of preclinical studies suggest that schedule and order of administration may be important. A Japanese study evaluated the combination in previously untreated patients with NSCLC, and found eight partial responses in 26 patients (32%). A recent phase I study at the Mayo Clinic showed partial responses in three of five patients who received irinotecan followed by docetaxel. In a phase I study conducted at Yale Cancer Center, escalating doses of docetaxel (25 to 40 mg/m2) were given before irinotecan (50 mg/m2) for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest. There was one partial response among five evaluable patients with NSCLC (one of four among patients who had received no prior chemotherapy). The results of these studies suggest that the combination of docetaxel and irinotecan shows promise in the treatment of NSCLC. Irinotecan also has been used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. The irinotecan/etoposide combination has been less extensively evaluated but thus far appears to be associated with considerable toxicity, particularly myelosuppression, without clear therapeutic advantage. One report of the use of the triple combination of irinotecan/cisplatin/etoposide resulted in 16 partial responses in 42 NSCLC patients (38%). Like docetaxel, irinotecan has been used effectively in conjunction with radiation therapy, with partial response rates in some studies of more than 70%."}

Mitotane and statins are known to exert anti\u2011proliferative effects in\u00a0vitro; however, the effects of statins have never been directly evaluated in patients with ACC and ACC cells, at least to the best of our knowledge.

In this study, we examined the effects of mitotane, rosuvastatin and their combination in NCI\u2011H295R human ACC cells using proliferation assays, gene expression analyses and free intracellular cholesterol measurements. The results revealed that mitotane dose\u2011dependently reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis and increased intracellular free cholesterol levels, considered as one of the key features of mitotane action, while rosuvastatin alone reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis at high concentrations. We also demonstrated that rosuvastatin potentiated the effects of mitotane by reducing cell viability, inducing apoptosis, increasing intracellular free cholesterol levels, and by decreasing the expression of 3\u2011hydroxy\u20113\u2011methylglutaryl\u2011CoA reductase (HMGCR) and ATP binding cassette subfamily a member\u00a01 (ABCA1), genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, and inhibiting steroidogenesis.

This method allows the analysis of melatonin in different biological fluids with small sample volumes (e.g. mice and rats), and wide working range. With the preparation of matrix-specific calibrators called \"Equalizing Reagent\" the influence of results due to different composition between standards and sample matrix was reduced. This reagent is produced by use of the respective biological liquid. Endogenous melatonin is removed by adsorption to activated charcoal. The melatonin-free biological liquid is then used to equalize the assay matrix of standards and untreated samples. Finally, all samples including the standards are digested by use of a protease to reduce non-specific binding, for example to albumin or albumin-like molecules. High-affinity specific antibodies were produced by immunization of rabbits with 5-methoxytryptamine-bovine serum albumin. The review of cross reactions to ten structurally similar compounds showed that the antibody has a high specificity for melatonin. This direct RIA uses a [(125)I]-melatonin tracer for the determination of melatonin. 5-methoxytryptamine was synthesized by direct iodination with [(125)I]-Bolton-Hunter-Reagent. The required acceptance criteria for validation parameters were fulfilled. The flexible standards cover a working range from 12 to 4000 pg/mL with a sample volume of 50 microL (e.g. working range from 3 to 1000 pg/mL with a sample volume of 200 microL). The limit of detection in mouse serum and mouse plasma was 9 pg/mL and 7 pg/mL, respectively. The recovery of melatonin in mouse serum was 108% and in mouse plasma 99%. The variation coefficients of the assay, within and between runs, ranged between 7 and 13% in mouse serum and between 5 and 8% in mouse plasma. Based on the determination of a 24-h profile of melatonin in mouse samples a characteristic diurnal rhythm of melatonin was observed. The wide working range makes it possible to analyse low and high melatonin concentrations. The validated direct RIA was compared with established sample preparation methods such as liquid-liquid- and solid-phase-extraction followed by RIA. The correlation for methanol extraction is y=1.1x-0.9, R(2)=0.98, P<0.001 and C(18)-extraction y=0.8x-0.03, R(2)=0.99, P<0.001. The distinct advantage of the direct assay of melatonin is that complicated extraction steps can be avoided. The realized advantages of the direct RIA when compared to a commercially available melatonin RIA are its low sample volume and ease of implementation. Exemplary, plasma melatonin was determined at C3H, C57BL, wild-type and melatonin receptor (MT1-/- and MT2-/-) knockout mice kept under L:D=12:12 cycles. The results have indicated that at all mouse strains have plasma melatonin content, with higher levels during the night and lower levels during the day. Because of different melatonin concentrations the direct RIA convince by its low detection limit and wide working range. The determination of serum and plasma melatonin in mice by ELISA or HPLC-technique previously failed due to the required use of a high sample volume and the low sensitivity. In summary, it can be concluded that the developed and validated direct RIA meets the requirements for the determination of melatonin and is especially suitable for the analysis of melatonin in different mouse strains."}

Bortezomib alone efficiently induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. Apoptosis was preceded by an upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor ATF3, and increased the expression of cytoplasmic heat shock proteins. Bortezomib enhanced the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells and tissue explants to an apoptosis-inducing TRAIL receptor antibody by upregulating the TRAIL receptor DR5. In contrast to the synergistic effect observed for TRAIL, the efficacy of the taxol treatment was reduced by bortezomib, and bortezomib inhibited the G2/M phase accumulation of ovarian cancer cells treated with taxol. Bortezomib alone or in combination with taxol induced a cell cycle arrest within the S phase, and downregulation of cdk1, a cyclin-dependent kinase that is necessary for the entry into the M phase. Thus, bortezomib can be regarded as a promising agent for the treatment of ovarian cancer and could either be administered as a single agent or in combination with TRAIL. However, a combination treatment with taxanes may not be beneficial and may even be less effective."}

However, its prolonged treatment develops multidrug resistance. Since lapatinib interacts with and inhibits P-gp activity, our objective was to determine whether the combination therapy of these two drugs can synergistically treat resistant prostate cancer. Our recently synthesized lipopolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxylpropylene carbonate-graft-dodecanol) (PEG-PCD), was used to efficiently load both drugs into PEG-PCD micelles since they are hydrophobic. Lapatinib inhibited P-gp function but not its expression. Co-treatment of DU145-TXR cells with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM paclitaxel and 5\u00a0\u03bcM lapatinib resulted in up to 138-fold reversal compared to paclitaxel alone. These formulations killed almost 70% and 80% of DU145-TXR cells when 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM paclitaxel was combined with lapatinib at a dose of 1 and 5\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively, while monotherapy had no effect. Combination therapy induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at mitotic phase. Xenograft tumor growth in athymic nude mice was significantly regressed when PEG-PCD micelles carrying lapatinib and paclitaxel were given intravenously twice a week. Furthermore, this combination therapy synergistically decreased antiangiogenic activity compared to the control or their monotherapy. In conclusion, lipopolymeric micelles carrying lapatinib and paclitaxel have the potential to treat resistant prostate cancer and can successfully deliver drugs to tumors while minimizing toxic effects associated with solubilizing agents.

The anti-proliferative and synergism potential effects were determined by MTT assay. Induction of apoptosis was analyzed employing annexing V and propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. VEGFA, CASP9, CASP3 and ABCB1 gene expression was evaluated by RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR analysis. OCT in combination with DTX treatments on DU145 cell migration was also evaluated. Investigation revealed that combined administration of DTX and OCT had significant, synergistically greater cytotoxicity than DTX or OCT treatment alone. The combination of the two drugs caused a more marked increase in apoptosis and resulted in greater suppression of invasive potential than either individual agent. There was obvious increase in caspase 3 expression in the OCT alone and two-drug combined treatment groups, however, VEGFA expression was markedly suppressed in them. These results support the conclusion that somatostatin analogues combined with docetaxel may enhance the chemotherapy efficacies through multiple mechanisms in castration-resistant PCa cell line.

Using rats lacking the bradykinin precursors low- and high-molecular-weight kininogen or a B(2) kinin receptor antagonist (icatibant), we investigated whether absence or blockade of the kallikrein-kinin system alters blood pressure (BP) in rats given (1) chronic infusion of Ang II, (2) a normal or high salt diet, or (3) chronic administration of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) plus salt. We confirmed the genotype and phenotype of Brown Norway Katholiek rats (BNK) and found that they had a G-to-A point mutation on the kininogen gene compared with Brown Norway (BN) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, very low levels of high-molecular-weight kininogen (17+/-3 ng/mL) compared with BN and SD (1814+/-253 and 2397+/-302 ng/mL, respectively; P:<0.01), and plasma low-molecular-weight kininogen concentrations below detectable limits compared with 1773+/-74 and 1781+/-140 ng/mL for BN and SD, respectively. Basal BP was the same in BNK and BN. Chronic infusion of icatibant did not alter BP in BN or Wistar rats. At doses that blocked the acute effect of bradykinin, icatibant did not potentiate the pressor effect of a chronic subpressor or pressor dose of angiotensin II in male and female Wistar rats nor that of a high salt diet (2%) plus unilateral nephrectomy in male Wistar rats. Moreover, blockade of the kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system in either BN rats given a very high dose of icatibant or kinin-deficient rats (BNK) did not potentiate the pressor effect of angiotensin II (nonpressor dose) or a high salt (3% NaCl) diet given for 2 weeks. Established DOCA-salt hypertension was not exaggerated in rats treated with icatibant but was partially attenuated by ramipril (1.5 mg. kg(-)(1). d(-)(1) for 7 days; P:<0.002). This antihypertensive effect was abolished by icatibant (P:<0.002, ramipril versus ramipril plus icatibant). These results suggest that endogenous kinins do not participate in the maintenance of normal blood pressure or antagonize the development of hypertension induced by chronic infusion of angiotensin II, a high salt diet, or DOCA-salt. However, kinins appear to play an important role in the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in DOCA-salt hypertension."}

However, no single universal cancer cure has yet been found, although combinations from the above areas have steadily improved survival outcomes. Hence, chemotherapy remains a key component in the oncologist's arsenal for cancer therapy, despite frequent development of drug resistance and more aggressive cancers with onset of advanced stage metastases. The focus here is to explore the repurposing of old drugs that cause pro-oxidative overload to overcome onset of resistance to chemotherapy and enhance chemotherapeutic responses, particularly against metastatic cancer. Excellent examples of US Food and Drug Administration approved drugs suitable for repurposing are the potent and specific thioreductase inhibitor auranofin and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, celecoxib. Recently, both drugs were shown to selectively target and kill metastatic cancer cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), predominantly by promoting excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Thus, targeting intracellular redox systems of advanced stage metastatic cancer cells and CSCs can promote an overload of pro-oxidative stress to activate the intrinsic pathway for programmed cell death. It is envisaged that more clinical studies will incorporate longer term use of repurposed drugs, such as auranofin or celecoxib, to target redox systems in cancer cells as part of common practice postcancer diagnosis, providing enhanced chemotherapeutic responses and increased cancer survival."}

We previously showed that downregulation of the expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin by EGFR-TKIs contributes to EGFR-TKI-induced apoptosis in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC cells. We have now investigated the role of survivin expression in EGFR-TKI resistance induced by PTEN loss. The EGFR-TKI erlotinib did not affect survivin expression or induce apoptosis in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC cells with PTEN loss. Downregulation of survivin either by transfection with a specific short interfering RNA or by exposure to the small-molecule survivin suppressor YM155 reversed erlotinib resistance in such cells in vitro. Furthermore, combination therapy with YM155 and erlotinib inhibited the growth of tumors formed by EGFR mutation-positive, PTEN-deficient NSCLC cells in nude mice to a greater extent than did treatment with either drug alone. These results thus indicate that persistent activation of signaling by the AKT-survivin pathway induced by PTEN loss underlies a mechanism of resistance to erlotinib-induced apoptosis in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. They further suggest that the targeting of survivin has the potential to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC."}

Western blotting respectively assayed protein expression of LC3I, LC3II, Beclin-1, Autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg7), Autophagy-related protein 3 (Atg3), NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) and major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA).

The biomarker proteins of autophagy, including Beclin-1, Atg7 and Atg3, decreased, but the ratios of LC3I/II increased. We also found that this drug combination sensitizes human cervical cancer cells to NK cell-mediated lysis by increasing the protein of SIRT3 and MICA.

Treated with intravenous unfractionated heparin and discharged home on warfarin, he returned a week later with extending thrombosis. Treatment with heparin followed by warfarin was reinitiated. Twenty-four hours following the re-administration of warfarin, the patient's INR increased to 14.5. The platelet count dropped by more than 50%, and he developed venous limb gangrene of the left leg and skin necrosis of the right leg. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was ruled out, and coagulation studies showed a severe depletion of protein C as well as increased thrombin generation. The patient was transfused with fresh frozen plasma, and vitamin K was given. Heparin was continued, and after 4 weeks, the patient improved markedly showing only minimal necrosis of the toes. Venous limb gangrene is a major complication associated with warfarin therapy. Its pathogenesis is explained by a transient hypercoagulable state produced by protein C depletion that leads to microvascular thrombi progressing to venous limb gangrene. The present case emphasizes the importance of careful anticoagulation with heparin followed by slow initiation of low-dose warfarin, in order to minimize thrombotic complications."}

These experiments were also repeated on SKBR3 cells transiently expressing GPX-1. CURC+TZMB cotreatment induced BC cell apoptosis more significantly than single treatment. GDNF highly inhibited CURC+TZMB toxicity and restored survival. Ectopic overexpression of GPX-1 per se induced SKBR3 cell death that was accelerated upon CURC+TZMB cotreatment. This substantial death induction was inhibited by GDNF more robustly than in single-treated cells. All these changes correlated with changes in expression levels of key molecules and were further confirmed by flow cytometry and correlation analysis. Our data indicate apoptotic induction is jointly shaped in BC cells by CURC, TZMB, and GPX-1 which correlates directly with their tripartite synergism and inversely with GDNF progrowth effects. In light of the active presence of GDNF in tumor microenvironment and necessity to overcome drug resistance, our findings can help in designing combined therapeutic strategies with implications for challenging TZMB resistance in BC."}

It is regarded as a type IV hypersensitivity reaction associated with certain infections, medications, and other various triggers. Allergic contact dermatitis is in turn a delayed type of induced allergy as a result of cutaneous contact with a specific allergen to which the patient develops specific sensitivity. This type of cutaneous reaction is associated with inflammation manifesting with erythema, edema, and vesicles. A 27-year old female patient presented with a 3-day history of erythematous and vesicular lesions which developed 24 hours after cesarean section. Initially the lesions were localized in the area of surgery (mainly the abdomen and upper thighs) and on the next day progressed to the buttocks and lumbar area. The patient was referred to the Outpatient Clinic and was treated with antihistamines, but her dermatological state deteriorated rapidly. At the day of admission to the Department of Dermatology, numerous erythematous and vesicular lesions were present on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, and back (Figure 1, a), but the skin of the neck, chest, and extremities was also covered with erythematous and edematous patches. On the second day of hospitalization, we observed the evolution of lesions localized within the chest and extremities into an erythema multiforme-like targetoid eruption (Figure 1, b). Initially the patient was treated with intravenous injections of dexamethasone and ceftriaxone and orally with second-generation antihistamines (in four-fold doses), followed by intravenous metyloprednisolone pulse-therapy (total dose of 3 g). As the new vesicobullous lesions started to appear on the face and arms, we introduced cyclosporine A orally 400 mg daily. We could then observe gradual remission, but on the seventh day of hospitalization the patient developed a massive labial herpes simplex infection and had to be treated with acyclovir intravenously. Eight days after admission, we switched from intravenous metyloprednisolone to its oral formula. Diagnostic methods included: laboratory analyses (leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia could be observed, and also serum CRP elevation). Pemphigoid gestationis was excluded on the basis of a direct immunofluorescence from perilesional skin and on the basis of indirect immunofluorescence and also serum analysis using ELISA for serum IgG antibodies to BP180-NC16A (courtesy of Prof. Marian Dmochowski). Histopathological examination revealed: massive edema of dermal papillae, leading to the formation of sub-epidermal vesicles; individual cell necrosis was observed in the upper epidermis. Within the dermis, a dense, perivascular inflammatory infiltrate was detected: the clinical picture suggested erythema multiforme. Another histopathological examination was performed at the University Clinic of Dermatology and Venereology in Magdeburg, courtesy of Prof. Dr. Harald Gollnick and Dr. Med. I. Franke; it also suggested the bullous form of erythema multiforme (dermal type). Three months after remission, the patient was hospitalized again to perform allergological diagnostics. Patch tests were performed with the European Baseline Series (Chemotechnique Diagnostics) supplemented with disinfectants and textiles used during surgical procedure. For patch testing, Finn Chambers on Scanpor were used. Results were recorded at 48 and 72 hour time points. According to the ICDRG (International Contact Dermatitis Research Group), reactions evaluated as ++ and +++ pluses were considered as positive and reaction evaluated as + plus was considered as doubtful. Patch testing revealed polyvalent contact allergy (Table I), (Figure 2a). The patient also reacted to Kodan Tinctur forte used as a skin disinfectant (contains brown dye LF 1889 - mixture of quinoline yellow, sunset yellow, brilliant black) (Figure 2b). It has to be emphasized, that patch test reading procedure was difficult due to patient's skin reactivity toward a plaster mounting Finn chambers. Literature data suggests that erythema multiforme may occasionally occur in conjunction with allergic contact dermatitis to various non-related substances including chemicals (epoxy-based compound, fragrances, epichlorydrine, bromofluorene), medications (antibiotics, acetaminophen, triamcinolone, bufexamac), plant-derived allergens (poison ivy, tea tree oil, red cedar essential oil), but also rubber ingredients and nickel. The severity of the reaction varies from mild erythema to generalized erythema multiforme or even toxic epidermal necrolysis (1,2,3,4). Lesions characteristic for erythema multiforme may appear during the episode of acute contact dermatitis or may follow a nearly resolving vesicular eczematous eruption. The pathomechanism Patomechanism of an erythema multiforme-like eruption developing in association with allergic contact dermatitis still remains unclear. Immune complex-mediated and T-cell-mediated reactions have been proposed as the cause. However, T-cell-mediated cellular mechanisms seems to be more likely, since generalized erythema multiforme often follows contact dermatitis, which is a type IV allergic reaction mediated by T cells (5,6). According to Bushkell et al. (7), an allergen penetration through the skin may result in a type III hypersensitivity reaction, with involvement of circulating immune complexes, and to confirm that, IgM, IgA, C3, and fibrin deposits are detected in some cases of targetoid lesions in erythema multiforme. On the other hand, Wiedemeyer et al. (8) suggest that contact allergens (i.e. paraphenylenodiamine) may be transported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the area of initial skin contact even to distant sites. According to Shiohara et al. (9) and Gonzalez-Delgado et al. (10), epidermal expression of adhesion molecule - 1 (ICAM-1) and the number of CD4+ T cells is increased within the iris lesions of erythema multiforme. Thus, it is possible that adhesion molecules may facilitate epidermal invasion of lymphocytes in these lesions, which is also the place of the expression of maintained allergen molecules. In conclusion, in the described case the causative factor also remained uncertain. The patient was found to have contact allergy to six haptens included in the European Baseline Series and also to a disinfectant used during cesarean section. Among these, both colophonium and formaldehyde are used in adhesives and glues or surface coatings. However, formaldehyde is mainly associated with this type of the reaction - in fact, hapten description supplied by Chemotechnique Diagnostics includes the information that \"formaldehyde may produce erythema multiforme-like eruptions\"."}

BER shows synergistic effects with some existing anticancer agents such as trichostatin A (TSA, the histone deacetylase inhibitor), celecoxib (the inhibitor of COX-2), and carmofur against the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. BER also displays the strong activity of inducing apoptosis in both estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cells and estrogen receptor-alpha-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but not in normal human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A. BER down-regulates anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 levels and up-regulates pro-apoptotic protein Bax expressions in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435S cells. BER also has synergistic effects with anticancer agents trichostatin A, celecoxib and/or carmofur on reducing Bcl-2/Bax ratios and VEGF secretions in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, BER significantly suppresses cell migration and invasion, as well as decreases pro-MMP-9/pro-MMP-2 activation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, BER suppresses Akt and nuclear factor kappaB signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of c-Met and Akt, and inhibiting their downstream targets such as nuclear factor kappaB p-65, Bcl-2/Bax, osteopontin, VEGF, MMP-9 and MMP-2 on protein and/or mRNA levels in breast cancer cells."}

Preclinical evidence suggests a similar potential role for IFN-alpha combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and 5-fluorouracil (CAF) in advanced adenocarcinoma of the breast. To determine a maximum tolerated dose of IFN-alpha that could be combined with CAF and that did not compromise CAF dose intensity and to determine the effect of IFN-alpha on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, a phase I study of IFN-alpha plus CAF was performed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Nine patients with advanced breast cancer received CAF (cyclophosphamide at 100 mg/m2/day p.o. on days 1-14, doxorubicin at 30 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil at 500 mg/m2 i.v. bolus on days 1 and 8) plus IFN-alpha (1 milliunit/m2, n = 6, or 2 milliunits/m2, n = 3) given s.c. on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 (1 h prior to the doxorubicin and 5-FU injection on days 1 and 8) of each cycle every 28 or more days.

During cycle 1, IFN-alpha was omitted on day 1, and multiple plasma samples were drawn on day 1 (without IFN-alpha) and day 8 (with IFN-alpha) after each doxorubicin injection and were analyzed for plasma doxorubicin concentration. The maximum tolerated dose of IFN-alpha by our criteria was 1 milliunit/m2, and neutropenia was the predominant toxic effect that precluded IFN-alpha dose escalation. The dose intensity of CAF achieved with IFN-alpha was identical to that for CAF alone observed in prior studies. IFN-alpha had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, although 3 of 7 patients studied had reduced doxorubicin clearance, ranging from 32% to 69%. Alternative CAF drug delivery schedules (all drugs given i.v. every 3-4 weeks) that are more amendable to hematopoietic growth factor support may be more suitable to combine with higher doses of IFN-alpha that may produce modulation."}

All the mice were sacrificed 6 months after irradiation. As an end point, the extent of renal tubular atrophy for each mouse was quantified with image analysis of histological sections of the kidney. Tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were also measured in each animal. In the histopathological examination of the mouse kidneys, there was a statistically significant reduction (P<0.05) in the presence of tubular atrophy between the RT+M and RT+G groups and the RT group. There was a statistically significant increase in MDA levels in the irradiated versus sham groups (RT vs. C; P<0.05); however, MDA levels were significantly decreased by co-treatment with melatonin or genistein vs. RT alone (RT+M and RT+G vs. RT; P<0.05). In conclusion, the present experimental study showed that melatonin and genistein supplementation prior to irradiation-protected mice against RIN, which may have therapeutic implications for radiation-induced injuries."}

Nine male patients were enrolled and received aripiprazole monotherapy (30 mg once daily) for 14 days, after which aripiprazole steady-state pharmacokinetics were assessed. Subjects were then administered carbamazepine together with aripiprazole for 4 to 6 weeks. The dose of carbamazepine was titrated to produce a trough serum concentration within the range of 8 to 12 mg/L. Aripiprazole pharmacokinetics were then assessed in the presence of carbamazepine. Six patients completed the study as designed. Coadministration with carbamazepine decreased the values of mean peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of aripiprazole by 66% and 71%, respectively (P = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Similarly, coadministration with carbamazepine decreased the values of mean peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the 24-hour dosing interval of the major active metabolite of aripiprazole, dehydroaripiprazole, by 68% and 69%, respectively (P < 0.001). Both aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole are substrates for the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme which is known to be induced by carbamazepine dosed to steady state. Thus, therapeutic doses of carbamazepine had significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled (to 20-30 mg/d). Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. When carbamazepine is withdrawn from combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be reduced."}

The recognition that there are two cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, one predominating at sites of inflammation (COX-2) and one constitutively expressed in the gastrointestinal tract (COX-1), has led to the important therapeutic development of COX-2 inhibitors. COX-2 is phylogenetically more primitive that COX-1 and, while very similar, has critical differences, particularly the existence of a small pocket half way down the active enzyme site. A number of drugs achieve selectivity by binding to this pocket, including presumptively rofecoxib and celecoxib. Others, such as meloxicam, may inhibit COX-2 by different mechanisms. Truly selective COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to have no effect on gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis, to cause no acute injury, and no chronic ulceration compared to placebo. Rofecoxib has, in a prospective systematic evaluation involving 8076 patients, been shown to reduce clinically significant ulcers, ulcer complications and gastrointestinal bleeding significantly compared to naproxen. Outcomes data for celecoxib have also been published although differences from the combined comparator agents (diclofenac and ibuprofen) did not reach statistical significance. Use of aspirin in the class study has shown that the benefits of COX-2 inhibitors may be reduced by aspirin use.

In addition to standard threeweekly dosing regimens, alternative schedules of administration of taxanes and gemcitabine doublets (weekly, twoweekly) might deserve further investigation due to their potential usefulness in reducing pharmacological toxicity while maintaining or increasing dose-intensity and clinical efficacy.

One particular group of macromolecules, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), has been of interest in our laboratory. The GAGs chondroitin A, chondroitin C, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and keratan sulfate have all been shown to be inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystallization. Heparin, the only GAG which is not naturally present in urine, is the most potent inhibitor of all GAGs. Using the method of Langmuir isotherm adsorption, we studied the adsorption of certain GAGs onto calcium oxalate crystals. Under standardized conditions, heparin, chondroitin C, hyaluronic acid, and pentosan polysulfate (a synthetic polyanionic molecule similar to, but a weaker inhibitor than, heparin) were adsorbed onto calcium oxalate. The total amount of GAG required to maximally cover the crystal surface, as well as the equilibrium concentration at which surface was half-covered with GAG (inversely related to the desorption energy) were measured. Chondroitin C was adsorbed in the greatest amount, followed by heparin, pentosan polysulfate, and finally hyaluronic acid. Using the method of fiducial limits, the only insignificant difference was between heparin and chondroitin C, and between hyaluronic acid and pentosan polysulfate. Pentosan polysulfate required significantly higher equilibrium concentration than heparin and hyaluronic acid to cover half of the surface of the calcium oxalate crystals. The principle of Langmuir isotherm adsorption can be useful in predicting the effects of macromolecules on crystallization. Weaker inhibitors bind with less affinity than do stronger inhibitors. Further work is underway to characterize other inhibitors and promoters."}

In vitro cytotoxicity were first investigated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), gemcitabine, monepantel as single agents and then in combination with monepantel on ovarian tumor cells. Drug effect on oncogenic proteins was determined by western blot analysis and resistance to drugs by colony formation assays. Using in vivo model (nude mice), a similar study, as above, was carried out to determine correlation to in vitro findings. Close correlation existed between in vitro and in vivo studies with the latter indicating that combination of monepantel with either low or high dose PLD was more effective compared to single drug therapy. A similar finding existed for gemcitabine, with gemcitabine showing a more superior efficacy (100% ablation) in combination with MPL. Western blot analysis indicated p-mTOR, p70s6K and 4E-BP1 were severely inhibited by combination of MPL with either PLD or gemcitabine.

Clinical signs of infection had significantly declined in Groups 2, 3 and 4 by 10 days after treatment reaching their lowest level at D30. In the control group during this period, clinical signs increased. Ten days after the second treatment, (D70), there was also evidence of a significant response to treatment. Finally the between-treatment differences in clinical scores of the closantel and ivermectin groups were small, although scores in Group 1 sheep was suggestive of a higher challenge in the second half of the study. On the basis of the postmortem counts and arithmetic means, prophylactic efficacies for the treatments relative to ABZ treated group, were 97.7, 62.5 and 0%, for the closantel, Isc and Io groups respectively. Therapeutic efficacies for the closantel, Isc and Io were 100, 100 and 98% respectively."}

Bacillus spp. were most sensitive to the antibiotic; effective lysis occurred at 0.1 microgram teicoplanin ml-1. The bacteriolytic effect depended on the antibiotic concentration, the growth phase and growth rate of the target organism. Antibiotic added to overnight cultures did not cause lysis. Mg2+ (50 mM) was unable to prevent lysis. Mutants with decreased autolytic activity were more resistant to teicoplanin and lysed more slowly than the wild-type. Growth of bacteria in slightly acidic medium protected the cells against the lytic effect of teicoplanin typically observed at pH 7 or 8. This pH-dependent antibiotic tolerance was demonstrated with both bacilli and streptococci. Bacterial lysis was prevented by the presence of Ac-L-Lys(Ac)-D-Ala-D-Ala and normal growth was observed when this peptide was added simultaneously with teicoplanin. Bacteria pretreated with teicoplanin, washed and transferred to fresh medium or buffers behaved as if the antibiotic was still present; in neutral or slightly alkaline conditions strong lysis occurred, whereas in acidic buffer only bacteriostasis was observed. In contrast to vancomycin, teicoplanin induced some lysis of bacteria in hypertonic media, presumably by affecting the integrity of the cell membrane."}

The promising clinical activity of docetaxel has also promoted considerable interest in combining this drug with other antitumor agents. In this study, we assessed the cytotoxic interaction between docetaxel and doxorubicin administered at various schedules to human breast and ovarian cancer cells. Through a series of in vitro assays including DNA fragmentation analyses, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, and flow cytometric analyses, we found that the antagonistic interaction occurred when tumor cells were exposed to the two drugs simultaneously or exposed to doxorubicin before docetaxel. However, no antagonism was observed when docetaxel was added before doxorubicin. Further analyses demonstrated that doxorubicin could interfere with the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel on both mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death. In addition, biochemical examinations revealed that docetaxel could induce phosphorylation of both bcl-2 and c-raf-1, but these changes were inhibited when tumor cells were pretreated or simultaneously treated with doxorubicin. These results indicate that the interaction between docetaxel and doxorubicin is highly schedule dependent. Exposure of tumor cells to doxorubicin before docetaxel could result in pronounced antagonism. The optimal schedule for this combination might be sequential exposure to docetaxel followed by doxorubicin."}

The hemodynamic profile of diltiazem (reduction in peripheral resistance and heart rate) would seem to be particularly favorable in acute infarction, while nifedipine is preferred in acute infarction plus hypertension.

Quinacrine, chloroquine, tetracaine and procaine inhibited [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding to solubilized membrane with pKi values of 7.03 +/- 0.10, 6.59 +/- 0.02, 5.40 +/- 0.10 and 5.03 +/- 0.04 and reduced receptor occupancy by agonist from 99.0% (without inhibitor) to 96.8%, 95.1%, 89.4% and 49.8%, respectively, under the conditions where each drug induced half-maximum inhibition of desensitization, indicating that they (except for procaine) did not effectively block muscarinic receptors. However, the combined dose-ratio test showed that some of these drugs (quinacrine and chloroquine) interacted noncompetitively at muscarinic receptors. Therefore, these drugs could have bound to an allosteric site on the receptor, modified agonist-receptor interaction and thus inhibited the pathway specific to the desensitization process."}

In this paper, we discuss both chemo- and dietary prevention strategies for colorectal cancer, recognising the overlap and cross-fertilisation between these two approaches. Chemopreventive compounds are drugs and are developed for clinical use like other pharmaceuticals. A formal sequential multi-phase programme for development of chemopreventive agents has been instituted by the National Cancer Institute, U.S.A. This involves both preclinical efficacy and clinical studies. Such studies increasingly employ preneoplastic intermediate markers (such as proliferation measures) as well as neoplastic adenomas as endpoints. Promising chemopreventive agents include calcium, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamins (such as vitamin E and folate), 2-dimethylfluorornithine (DFMO), oltipraz and ursodeoxycholic acid. Several lines of evidence implicate diet in colorectal carcinogenesis. Key hypotheses in diet and colorectal cancer (which are amenable to prevention, research and action), in addition to those pertaining to the micronutrient chemopreventives, include dietary fat and fibre, food mutagens, red meat, and overall low-fat, high-fibre, high fruit and vegetable dietary patterns and cuisines. Several adenomatous polyp recurrence studies with fibre supplement, macronutrient or dietary pattern interventions have been undertaken internationally. We review early findings from this new generation of studies, and anticipate the future results from these investigations and the ambitious Women's Health initiative in the U.S.A. Results from these studies may convert the promise of colorectal cancer prevention into reality."}

Clinical responses to bendamustine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are highly heterogeneous and no specific markers to predict sensitivity to this drug have been reported. In order to identify biomarkers of response, we analyzed the in vitro activity of bendamustine and the gene expression profile in primary CLL cells. We observed that mRNA expression of CD69 (CD69) and ITGAM (CD11b) constitute the most powerful predictor of response to bendamustine. When we interrogated the predictive value of the corresponding cell surface proteins, the expression of the activation marker CD69 was the most reliable predictor of sensitivity to bendamustine. Importantly, a multivariate analysis revealed that the predictive value of CD69 expression was independent from other clinico-biological CLL features. We also showed that when CLL cells were co-cultured with distinct subtypes of stromal cells, an upregulation of CD69 was accompanied by a reduced sensitivity to bendamustine. In agreement with this, tumor cells derived from lymphoid tumor niches harbored higher CD69 expression and were less sensitive to bendamustine than their peripheral blood counterparts. Furthermore, pretreatment of CD69 high CLL cases with the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib decreased CD69 levels and enhanced bendamustine cytotoxic effect. Collectively, our findings indicate that CD69 could be a predictor of bendamustine response in CLL patients and the combination of clinically-tested BCR signaling inhibitors with bendamustine may represent a promising strategy for bendamustine low responsive CLL cases.

We have shown AS in combination with bicalutamide (Bic) attenuates the oncogenic properties of the castrate-resistant (PC3, 22RV1) and androgen-responsive (LNCaP) PCa cells. Mechanistically, AS and Bic combination inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling and decreases AR and/or AR-variant 7 expression via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. The combination induces oxidative stress and apoptosis via survivin downregulation and caspase-3 activation, resulting in poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, preclinical castrate-resistant PC3 xenograft studies in NOD/SCID mice (n =28, seven per group) show remarkable tumor regression and significant reduction in lungs and bone metastases upon administering AS (50 mg/kg per day in two divided doses) and Bic (50 mg/kg per day) via oral gavage. Taken together, we for the first time provide a compelling preclinical rationale that AS could disrupt AR antagonist-mediated resistance observed in mCRPC. The current study also indicates that the therapeutic combination of Food and Drug Administration-approved AS or NF-\u03baB inhibitors and AR antagonists may enhance the clinical efficacy in the treatment of mCRPC patients."}

Atorvastatin (10, 20 mg/kg), simvastatin (30 mg/kg) and fluvastatin (10 mg/kg) treatment significantly attenuated the quinolinic acid induced behavioral (locomotor activity, rotarod performance and beam walk test), biochemical (lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration, SOD and catalase), mitochondrial enzyme complex alterations in rats suggesting their free radical scavenging potential. Additionally, atorvastatin (10, 20 mg/kg), simvastatin (30 mg/kg) and fluvastatin (10 mg/kg) significantly decrease the TNF-\u03b1 level and striatal lesion volume in quinolinic acid treated animals indicating their anti-inflammatory effects. In comparing the protective effect of different statins, atorvastatin is effective at both the doses while simvastatin and fluvastatins at respective lower doses were not able to produce the protective effect in quinolinic acid treated animals. These modulations can account, at least partly, for the beneficial effect of statins in our rodent model of striatal degeneration. Our findings show that statins could be explored as possible neuroprotective agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as HD."}

In the present study, [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) ([35S]GTPgammaS) binding assay in rat hippocampal membranes was applied to a series of antipsychotic drugs, especially atypical antipsychotics. 3. Most, but not all, of atypical antipsychotic drugs and the classical antipsychotic drug nemonapride behaved as partial agonists at 5-HT1A receptors with varied potencies and relative efficacies. The most potent compound was perospirone with a mean EC50 of 27 nmol/L, followed by aripiprazole (45 nmol/L) > ziprasidone (480 nmol/L) > nemonapride (790 nmol/L) > clozapine (3900 nmol/L) > quetiapine (26,000 nmol/L).

Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cyproterone monotherapy in patients with prostate cancer, and for those in whom orchiectomy is not an acceptable option cyproterone may be a useful alternative. In addition, the drug may be administered in combination with surgical or gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist-mediated castration to ensure ablation of adrenal androgens. However, the effectiveness of cyproterone in combination with these forms of testicular androgen deprivation remains to be fully established. Trials to date have not demonstrated prolonged survival in patients receiving the combination therapy. Importantly, however, cyproterone does prevent acute exacerbation of disease during initial treatment with a GnRH agonist. Furthermore, combination therapy tends to be associated with a lower incidence of hot flushes than GnRH agonist-mediated or surgical castration alone. Thus, cyproterone 200 mg/day has proven efficacy in preventing acute flare of disease and reducing the incidence of hot flushes associated with GnRH agonist therapy or orchiectomy. It may also facilitate maximal androgen deprivation in patients receiving GnRH agonist therapy. If this drug is used as monotherapy, dosages of 250 mg/day or greater will probably be required."}

Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which activates the protein kinase C pathway (PKC), does not cause C5a receptor (C5aR) expression when used as a single agent. The induction of C5aR by the synergistic actions of 1,25(OH)2D and cAMP, however, can be augmented as much as 180% by the addition of PMA. C5aR arising in cells exposed to 1,25(OH)2D and 8,4-chlorophenylthio-cAMP have an affinity constant of about 0.4 nM as assessed by cold competition analysis. We show here that when phorbol augmentation of receptor number occurs, the affinity constant is increased by 3.6-fold. In an effort to ascertain whether the change in C5aR Kd involved a PKC-dependent event we examined whether 5-60 min exposure of C5aR-positive cells to PMA would change C5aR Kd. Acutely, PMA caused a downregulation of receptor binding with decreases in apparent receptor number out of proportion to changes in Kd. One hundred nanomolar PMA, which effects nearly complete translocation of PKC to the membrane, consistently caused a 70-90% decrease in C5a surface binding. This downregulation was proportional to PMA dose and exposure time. Micromolar concentrations of the microtubule depolymerizing agents colchicine and vinblastine caused a less drastic downregulation, about 50% of the maximal phorbol effect. Our data suggest that activation of the PKC system might acutely limit the macrophage's ability to respond to C5a; chronically, phorbols upregulate receptor expression, most likely through positive effects on C5aR gene expression."}

Randomized control trials (RCTs) have shown promising results with a combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib to block two important tumor growth pathways, namely vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor. Aim of the Review We aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib with bevacizumab alone in the maintenance treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, by examining PFS, OS, overall response rate (ORR), and toxicity. This study performed a systematic review meta-analysis using existing randomized clinical trial. Methods Randomized controlled trials\u00a0were systematically reviewed from PubMed, Cochrane library, SCOPUS, CRD, and Google scholar databases. After evaluating the quality of studies through the Cochrane checklist, data of the relevant studies were extracted. This meta-analysis included outcomes of overall survival, progression-free survival of the disease through the hazard ratio, and the upper and lower confidence intervals for the third and fourth degree side effects of relative risk. To perform the meta-analysis for both types of survival, two fixed and random effect models were used. Results A total of three trials, providing data of 682 patients who received maintenance treatment, were included in this meta-analysis. Conclusion The combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib significantly increased the overall survival compared to using bevacizumab alone [HR\u2009=\u20090.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.93]. This combination, effectively increased progression-free survival [HR\u2009=\u20090.81, 95% CI 0.7-0.93] too.

For seizure control, levetiracetam, valproic acid, topiramate and lamotrigine can each be considered as agents of first choice. We advocate starting with levetiracetam monotherapy, based on efficacy, good tolerability and the absence of interactions. If levetiracetam alone is not sufficiently effective, we propose adding a second antiepileptic drug, rather than switching to monotherapy with another anticonvulsant. Under these circumstances we advise the use of valproic acid as an add-on over topiramate or lamotrigine, based on its reported clinical activity in brain tumor patients. The combination of levetiracetam and valproic acid seems synergistic, and produces few or no cognitive side effects. Antitumor therapy by neurosurgery, cranial radiation or chemotherapy contribute substantially to reducing seizure activity. Future research on seizure management in brain tumor patients should focus on better insight into the influence of multidrug resistance proteins on anticonvulsant drug transport over the blood-brain barrier, efficacy of new anticonvulsants with no or few interactions with other drugs, synergistic combinations of anticonvulsants in order to limit toxicity and therapeutic drug monitoring of anticonvulsants in current clinical practice and in new drug studies, including the effects of concomitant administration of chemotherapeutic agents."}

Combined chemotherapy and thoracic radiation therapy has emerged as a primary treatment option for locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Randomized trials and subsequent metaanalyses have shown a clear survival benefit with platinum-based combination chemotherapy administered sequentially or concurrently with hyperfractionated thoracic radiation over radiation alone. Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) and carboplatin recently have been evaluated in numerous phase 1/11 trials at various doses in both sequential and concurrent schedules with thoracic radiation in patients with locally advanced and unresectable NSCLC. The patterns of failure in patients treated with concurrent paclitaxel/carboplatin and thoracic radiation suggest the need for additional chemotherapy either at the front end or after completion of the concurrent regimen. A large multicenter randomized study (Locally Advanced Multimodality Protocol) has been initiated to address these issues of improvement in distant control and to further refine the combined-modality approach for patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Several other combined-modality regimens incorporating a platinum compound and a novel agent like gemcitabine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel have been recently completed or are in progress. The hope for the immediate future is to define an \"effective\" and \"optimal\" regimen that can be given simultaneously with thoracic radiation and can result in improved local and systemic control in patients with regionally advanced NSCLC. Numerous phase II and III trials are currently planned or under way to further define the efficacy of this novel combination of paclitaxel/carboplatin in combined-modality programs in an attempt to determine the optimal administration sequence of chemotherapy and thoracic radiation. These combined-modality programs are now being integrated into trials for early stage, potentially resectable disease. Thus, NSCLC is in fact a systemic disease requiring a multidisciplinary approach for optimal management."}

The current GOG study will help determine the relative benefits and toxicities of intraperitoneal P32 versus cyclophosphamide and cisplatin in this group of patients. Recent studies in advanced ovarian carcinoma suggest a modest additional benefit for multidrug regimens, but cisplatin and cyclophosphamide remains an acceptable first line treatment for stage III and IV disease. Additional information on the use of carboplatin in advanced disease has been published, and this agent is now accepted as part of standard first line treatment programs. Platinum-based chemotherapy continues to be the mainstay of treatment for recurrent disease. With the commercial availability of taxol, a new salvage treatment is now available. Taxol will be increasingly studied as a part of front-line therapy as well as its role in the salvage setting. Altretamine and ifosfamide appear to have activity even in some patients with platinum-resistant disease, but these drugs will not likely have a major impact on ovarian cancer treatment. The use of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell support offers an exciting and potentially beneficial approach for patients with poor prognosis disease. The use of intraperitoneal chemotherapy and biologic agents continues to be problematic, and additional improvements are needed before they are considered useful outside of a research setting. With the exception of P32 for early stage disease, radiation therapy is likely to continue to play a minor role in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Few studies involving non-epithelial ovarian carcinomas were published during the past year. A definitive report was published demonstrating the activity of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (BEP) in patients with advanced dysgerminoma. Chemotherapy which preserves fertility provides an effective alternative to irradiation. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy was active in mixed mullerian tumors of the ovary although the prognosis of these patients was worse than patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Concurrent chemotherapy added to irradiation has not improved survival over radiotherapy alone in patients with cancer of the uterine cervix. Patients still failed locally and distantly. Extended field irradiation to involved paraaortic lymph nodes with weekly cisplatin generated promising pilot data. Randomized trials evaluating the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to pelvic radiotherapy showed no benefit and increased toxicity. Ifosfamide alone or in combination regimens is an active drug but with serious side effects which require careful monitoring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}

All single pure drugs were relatively stable and showed only 3%-5% degradation under accelerated conditions for 3 months. However, significant interactions were observed in case of the drug mixtures. In particular, ternary and quaternary drug combinations containing R and H along with Z and/or E were very unstable, showing 90%-95% and 70%-75% loss of R and H, respectively. In all these cases, isonicotinyl hydrazone (HYD) of 3-formylrifamycin and H was found to be the major degradation product. In case of RE and RZE mixtures, where H was absent, 3-formylrifamycin was instead the key degradation product. Another unidentified peak was observed in the mixture containing RZE. Apart from these chemical changes, considerable physical changes were also observed in pure E and the mixtures containing E, viz., RE, ZE, RHE, RZE, and RHZE. In addition, significant physical changes associated with noteworthy loss of H and E were also observed in mixtures containing HE and HZE.

Through a series of in vitro assays including DNA fragmentation analyses, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, and flow cytometric analyses, we found that the antagonistic interaction occurred when tumor cells were exposed to the two drugs simultaneously or exposed to doxorubicin before docetaxel. However, no antagonism was observed when docetaxel was added before doxorubicin. Further analyses demonstrated that doxorubicin could interfere with the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel on both mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death. In addition, biochemical examinations revealed that docetaxel could induce phosphorylation of both bcl-2 and c-raf-1, but these changes were inhibited when tumor cells were pretreated or simultaneously treated with doxorubicin. These results indicate that the interaction between docetaxel and doxorubicin is highly schedule dependent. Exposure of tumor cells to doxorubicin before docetaxel could result in pronounced antagonism. The optimal schedule for this combination might be sequential exposure to docetaxel followed by doxorubicin."}

The single-agent activity of statins in ovarian cancer has been widely reported, however the drug concentration required to cause cell death is considerably higher than that achieved in patients receiving statin treatment for hypercholesterolemia. Unfortunately, statins can cause myopathy when administered in high doses. One solution to this is to identify drugs that could be used in combination with statins to reduce the dose required and those that may potentially reduce the incidence of adverse side effects. When the BH3 mimetic ABT-737, or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor pictilisib, were combined with pitavastatin in cell growth assays using Ovcar-3 and Igrov-1 cells, the drug combinations were more effective than pitavastatin alone.

Response was influenced independently by age, gender, and by previous treatment. Toxicity overall was more severe in patients randomized to MTX plus placebo (P = .016). This was accounted for primarily by differences in toxicities related to bone marrow function (neutrophil and platelet counts), stomatitis, and elevations of liver function tests. MTX therapy was more often interrupted for toxicity in the placebo group (P = .007) and discontinued for progressive disease in the LV group (P = .07).

In contrast, atropine did not significantly inhibit the GH response to surgery. In conclusion, octreotide completely suppressed GH secretion during surgery, whereas cholinergic blockade was ineffective. Thus surgery is similar to insulin induced hypoglycaemia poglycaemia in that the GH response is not decreased by cholinergic blockade."}

Approximately 13% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLC is generally classified as a limited-stage and extensive-stage disease depending on the extent of involvement. For patients with the extensive-stage disease, until recently, chemotherapy alone has been the recommended treatment, although radiotherapy could be used in select patients for palliation of symptoms. The standard of care for extensive-stage SCLC is platinum doublet chemotherapy with either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide. Even though first-line therapy has an initial response rate of 60-80%, the prognosis is poor, with overall survival of 10-12 months. The only FDA-approved second line of therapy is topotecan, approved both as an intravenous formulation as well as an oral formulation, with response rates of 6-12% in chemorefractory disease and 15-37% in chemosensitive disease. Immunotherapy has recently been approved as a first-line agent in metastatic SCLC in combination with chemotherapy. It is also approved as a third-line agent in metastatic SCLC after the failure of two chemotherapy regimens. The FDA approved four drugs, two of them being PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab), and two of them being PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab and durvalumab) in SCLC. This review article summarizes the significance of immunotherapy in the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC, its side effects, and limitations."}

The standard 5-day schedule of topotecan has demonstrated effectiveness and patient benefits. Topotecan at this dose is generally well tolerated, with dose-limiting myelosuppression. Preclinical data supported intermittent dosing with topotecan and clinical studies with weekly dosing in ovarian cancer have indicated reduced myelosuppression compared with the 5-day regimen. Several studies in non-small cell lung cancer investigated topotecan combined with cisplatin or gemcitabine and confirmed these findings. However, further studies are needed to confirm that efficacy of topotecan (response and survival) is maintained with the altered regimen."}

Standard treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma has not been defined. The range of treatment options includes close observation, surgical resection of isolated metastases, therapy with dacarbazine, combination chemotherapy, and participation in clinical trials. Numerous chemotherapeutic agents have shown activity in the treatment of malignant melanoma. Dacarbazine (DTIC-Dome; Bayer Corporation, West Haven, CT) has a response rate of 15% to 20% and remains the reference agent for the treatment of metastatic disease. Additional agents with single-agent activity include cisplatin, (Platinol-AQ; Bristol-Myers Oncology, Princeton, NJ); carmustine (BiCNU; Bristol-Myers Oncology, Princeton, NJ); paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ); and docetaxel (Taxotere; Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals, Collegeville, PA). Temozolomide (Temodar; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ), which is essentially an oral form of dacarbazine but with greater central nervous system penetrance, is associated with a response rate of 20%. Combination chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen has been extensively evaluated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Although the initial results with the Dartmouth regimen (dacarbazine, cisplatin, carmustine, and tamoxifen) were associated with overall response rates of 50% to 55% in single-institution studies, results from larger multicenter studies reveal responses rates ranging from 10% to 20%. Based on the results of several clinical trials, there is no evidence that the addition of tamoxifen improves the response rate. Another combination regimen is cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (CVD), which is associated with a 20% to 25% response rate. There has been widespread interest in developing immunotherapies against metastatic melanoma. Interferon (IFN)-alfa and interleukin (IL)-2 as single agents have produced response rates in the 15% to 20% range. Biochemotherapy, which is a combination of immunotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, has been studied in patients with metastatic melanoma. Multiple phase II studies have demonstrated high response rates but unclear impact on overall survival. Therapy is associated with significant toxicity. Ongoing randomized clinical trials will clarify the role of biochemotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma. Ongoing new approaches to treatment include the therapeutic use of vaccines alone or in combination with cytokines."}

In addition, the effects of antiepileptic drugs alone or in combination with vigabatrin were studied on motor performance and long-term memory. Chemical seizures were induced by subcutaneous injection of pentetrazole at its CD(97) and defined as a clonus of the whole body with an accompanying loss of righting reflex, lasting for over 3 s. Vigabatrin inhibited the clonic pentetrazole-induced seizures and ED(30) of the drug was 879 mg/kg. Vigabatrin (at the subthreshold dose of 250 mg/kg) potentiated the protective activity of ethosuximide, reducing its ED(30) from 142 to 95 mg/kg against clonic seizures induced by pentetrazole, but simultaneously elevated its plasma level. The protective activity of valproate and clonazepam remained almost unchanged. However, vigabatrin (250 mg/kg) decreased TD(30) (50% toxic dose - corresponding to the impairment of motor coordination in 50% of the animals) of ethosuximide and clonazepam from 549 and 3.84 to 460 and 1.1 mg/kg, respectively, in the chimney test. Vigabatrin (250 mg/kg) did not influence TD(30) value of valproate in this test. Vigabatrin (at the dose of 250 mg/kg) did not impair long-term memory in combination with antiepileptics. Potentiation of the ethosuximide's protective activity was apparently due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Consequently, no pharmacodynamic interactions between vigabatrin and the studied conventional antiepileptic drugs were evident."}

Twenty-three patients were treated with paclitaxel at doses ranging from 175 to 225 mg/m2 followed by carboplatin targeting area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) 7 or 9 mg/mL.min every 3 weeks. AUCs were targeted using the Calvert formula with estimated creatinine clearance as a surrogate for the glomerular filtration rate. A high rate of intolerable, mutually exclusive toxicities, consisting primarily of thrombocytopenia, as well as neutropenia, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis, precluded escalation of carboplatin above a targeted AUC of 7 mg/mL.min with paclitaxel 225 mg/m2, which approaches the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel given as a single agent on a 3-hour schedule. Moderate to severe peripheral neurotoxicity occurred in several patients after multiple courses.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were eligible. Sequential and concurrent schedules were studied.  RESULTS: Forty-three patients were studied in 9 different dose levels (6 sequential and 3 concurrent). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on the sequential schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg three times a day on days 6-12. The MTD on the concurrent schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 with vorinostat 200 mg twice a day on days 3-9. However, the sequential schedule of decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg twice a day on days 6-12 was more deliverable than both MTDs with fewer delays on repeated dosing and it represents the recommended phase II (RP2D) dose of this combination. Dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle consisted of myelosuppression, constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms and occurred in 12/42 (29%) patients evaluable for toxicity.

In randomized controlled trials in patients with advanced, predominantly clear-cell RCC, pazopanib significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in both treatment-na\u00efve and cytokine-pretreated patients and, as a first-line therapy, was noninferior to intermittent sunitinib with respect to PFS. However, pazopanib had a tolerability profile that was distinguishable from that of sunitinib, based on lower incidences of most adverse events, particularly those associated with discomfort, such as fatigue, hand-foot syndrome and stomatitis. Consistent with this, health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) measures evaluating fatigue, hand/foot soreness and mouth/throat soreness significantly favoured pazopanib over sunitinib. In addition, significantly more patients expressed a preference for pazopanib over sunitinib, primarily because of better overall HR-QOL and less fatigue. Efficacy and tolerability findings from these prospective clinical trials have been substantiated by evidence from a number of retrospective studies evaluating unselected real-world patients with metastatic RCC who received pazopanib (or sunitinib) as a first-line therapy. Thus, data from clinical trials supplemented with that from clinical practice support the use of pazopanib as a standard or alternative first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic RCC."}

Cyclophosphamide was used as a comparative control in these studies. Surprisingly, pargyline also reversed cyclophosphamide-induced suppression of the antibody response in the coculture system. The results with cyclophosphamide were not consistent with a role by MAO, and suggested that pargyline may not be selective for MAO. To confirm our hypothesis, the ability of pargyline to inhibit three cytochrome P-450 (P-450) isozyme-specific monooxygenase activities in vitro was studied using mouse liver microsomes. Pargyline, under the same concentration ranges that we used in the coculture studies, clearly inhibited the P-450IIE1-specific p-nitrophenol hydroxylase activity and P-450IIB1-specific pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activity. Taken together, our present results indicate that pargyline inhibits P-450 activity and is not selective for MAO. Although further studies are required to confirm a possible role by MAO in DMN-induced immunosuppression, our results suggest that pargyline may recover DMN-induced immunosuppression by primarily inhibiting the ability of P-450 enzymes in hepatocytes to activate DMN to its immunosuppressive metabolite(s)."}

In 10% serum, total proteoglycan production was increased 1.5-fold (P < 0.01) compared with basal production in 0.4% serum. Budesonide (10(-8) M) reduced this increase by 44% (P < 0.01) and, whereas formoterol (10(-10)-10(-8) M) had no inhibitory effects, the drug combination abolished the increase (P < 0.01) without affecting fibroblast proliferation. This synergistic effect required functional glucocorticoid and beta-adrenergic receptors. The production of the proteoglycans decorin, biglycan, perlecan, and versican was increased 2.5- to 5-fold (P < 0.01) in 10% serum. Combination treatment with budesonide (10(-8) M) and formoterol (10(-10) M) abolished this increase to a significantly greater extent than either drug alone. In 10% serum, only versican mRNA was increased 1.4-fold (P < 0.05), whereas decorin mRNA was reduced to 39% (P < 0.01) of basal expression. These serum effects were counteracted by the drug combination, but there were no significant differences between the combination and either drug alone. Thus, the budesonide and formoterol combination seems to synergistically control serum-induced proteoglycan production, primarily at the post-transcriptional level. In conclusion, the proteoglycan upregulation characteristic of asthmatic airways may be limited by combination therapy with budesonide and formoterol."}

Between June 2000 and July 2001, 30 patients with progressive disease (PD) during first-line chemotherapy (n = 11) or relapse after adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy of a metastatic or locally advanced TCC (n = 18) have been randomised to receive either six cycles (schedule A) of 3-weekly Gem (1000 mg/qm, days 1 and 8) and Pac (175 mg/qm, day 1) or 2-weekly treatment until disease progression (schedule B) with Gem (1250 mg/qm, day 1) and Pac (120 mg/qm, day 2). Restaging was performed after every 6 weeks by clinical imaging. Of 30 patients, one patient in schedule A and two patients in schedule B were not evaluable for response due to serious adverse events (SAEs) during the first cycle. The overall objective response (OR) was 44% (12 of 27) with eight complete remissions (CRs) and four partial remissions. Median time to progression (TTP) was 11 (3-41) months in schedule A and 6 (1-15+) months in schedule B. Median survival was 13 (5-46) months in schedule A and 9 (0-16) months in schedule B. Schedule A showed a significantly higher rate of CRs (7 vs. 1, p < 0.05). With a median number of six (1-6) cycles (A) and nine (1-23) cycles (B), TTP and survival were not significantly different. In schedule B, one patient had WHO grade IV anaemia and leucopenia. WHO grade III toxicities were seen in schedule A/B as follows: anaemia 3 (23%)/2 (16%) patients, leucopenia 5 (38%)/2 (16%), thrombocytopenia 0/2 (16%) and alopecia 10 (76%)/4 (32%). The combination of Gem and Pac is an effective second-line regimen in patients with mainly poor prognosis due to PD after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Except for three SAEs (uncertainly therapy related), both regimens were tolerated well. The 3-weekly schedule with a nonsplit Pac dose showed a significantly higher complete response rate in our small study population and, thus, might be superior to the 2-weekly schedule."}

Quercetin significantly decreased bioavailability of enrofloxacin and its transformation to ciprofloxacin. Lower formation of metabolite was also found in the studied tissues as spleen, heart, lungs and in liver of group treated in combination with quercetin. Results in infected and quercetin (50 mg/kg) treated group shows lower percentage of re-isolates of the pathogen bacteria in comparison to infected and untreated animals, and close to the low dose (10 mg/kg) of enrofloxacin. High dose of enrofloxacin given in a short time in an infection model with high inoculum size, resulted in better eradication of bacteria although re-isolates could be found in spleen. Additional improvement of the outcome of fluoroquinolone therapy could be searched in early start of drug administration according to the terms of metaphylaxis."}

A single-institution, randomised pilot trial was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy, microbiological efficacy and possible toxicity of empirical single daily antibiotic administration in febrile neutropenic patients with haematologic disorders (absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 10(9)/l). Upon the development of signs of sepsis, patients received either single daily dose tobramycin (5 mg/kg per day) plus ceftriaxone (2 g/day) (C + T, n = 47) or tobramycin (1.5 mg/kg, every 8 h) plus azlocillin (4 g, every 6 h) (A + T, n = 45). In addition, flucloxacillin (1-2 g, every 4 h) could be added if there was clinical suspicion of staphylococcal infection (17 in each arm). Analysis was performed for the whole group and for the subset which did not receive flucloxacillin. When evaluated at 96 h, 62% of patients randomised to C + T and 67% randomised to A + T had responded (95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in rates, -25% to +15%). Ninety-six hour response rates for those who did not receive flucloxacillin were 73% and 78%, respectively (95% CI, -17% to +27%). Overall, 42 (89%) and 41 (91%) patients, respectively, eventually became afebrile (95% CI, -14 to 10%) and there was no evidence of altered renal function or electrolyte imbalance in patients randomised to single daily antibiotic therapy compared with the conventional (multi-daily dose) arm. Within 10 days of antibiotic commencement there was 1 death in the C + T arm and 4 deaths in the A + T arm, although overall there were 4 deaths in each arm. Our results suggest that single daily empirical antibiotic therapy with tobramycin and ceftriaxone is efficacious and is not associated with an increased incidence of renal dysfunction or electrolyte imbalance compared with conventional administration schedules of azlocillin plus tobramycin. Single daily therapy has the potential to lead to savings in nursing-staff time and materials and may well contribute to an improved quality of life for febrile neutropenic patients."}

Here we investigate whether other commonly used drugs that interfere with GTP biosynthesis can induce RR structures in vitro and vivo and elicit generation of autoantibodies. HEp-2 cells treated for 24h with ribavirin, mycophenolic acid (MPA), azathioprine, methotrexate or acyclovir were positive for RR structures. However, adefovir, entecavir, tenofovir and lamivudine did not induce RR structures in these cells. Structures induced by ribavirin in HEp-2 cells are stable after 24h drug-washout, while structures induced by other drugs are relatively labile, disappearing within 2h. Looking at patients treated with these drugs, HCV patients treated with ribavirin (n=17) showed higher average percentage of RR-positive peripheral mononuclear cells than autoimmune patients treated with RR-inducing immunosuppressant drugs (n=21). Serum from 173 autoimmune patients who had been treated with MPA, azathioprine or methotrexate was tested for presence of anti-RR autoantibodies, and only one sample was found to be positive. Conversely, of 48 anti-RR autoantibody positive samples identified at Fleury Laboratories over 30months, 94% were from HCV patients treated with ribavirin plus IFN-\u03b1.

Cell lines with activating BRAF mutations were significantly more sensitive to vemurafenib than lines with NRAS mutations or lines lacking either mutation (p < 0.001).

Rucaparib demonstrated the greatest synergy with irinotecan, followed by olaparib and PJ34. Rucaparib and irinotecan was further subjected to detailed examination to determine combination index (CI) and underlying mechanism of action. Effectiveness and sequence dependence of this combination were assessed in microsatellite stable (MSS) and unstable (MSI) CRC and HCT116 isogenic cell lines. The degree of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was determined by FACS. In vivo studies were performed to confirm efficacy of this combination. PAR levels in MSI and PARP expression in MSI and MSS cell lines were diminished upon combinatorial treatment. HCT116 isogenic cells revealed the importance of p21, p53 and PTEN in exerting synergy. In MSI cells, administration of rucaparib prior to irinotecan enhanced cytotoxicity compared to other strategies explored. FACS revealed S-phase arrest and increased late-stage apoptosis in MSS, and G2-M arrest and total and early-stage apoptosis in MSI cells. In in vivo murine xenograft models, a significant reduction in tumor volume and expression of Ki67, pancytokeratin and RPS6KB1, and increase in expression of caspase 3 were observed with the combination. In conclusion, among the various combinations studied, rucaparib plus irinotecan was the most synergistic one. Alterations in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were dependent on MSI status in CRC cells."}

Prasugrel is a third-generation thienopyridine, recently approved for prevention of thrombotic cardiovascular complications in patients with an acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Prasugrel is converted to its active metabolite (Pras-AM; compound R-138727) in two sequential steps: (i) rapid and complete hydrolysis by intestinal human carboxylesterase-2 to form a thiolactone intermediate; and (ii) oxidation of the thiolactone by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the gut and/or the liver. CYP3A and CYP2B6 are the primary CYPs contributing to Pras-AM formation, with smaller contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Prasugrel is rapidly absorbed and metabolized, with Pras-AM plasma concentrations peaking at about 0.5 hours after oral administration; this helps to account for the rapid onset of inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) achieved by prasugrel. In the clinical pharmacology programme for prasugrel, bodyweight had the greatest effect of all covariates that were tested. In the phase III TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, the mean exposure to Pras-AM was 42% greater in patients weighing < 60 kg than in patients with the study population median bodyweight of 85 kg. In a pharmacodynamic meta-analysis of data from healthy subjects a decrease of 1 kg in bodyweight was associated with an increase in IPA of approximately 0.26 percentage points (p < 0.0001). Pras-AM exposure was greater in subjects aged \u2265 75 years, but exposure differences were not as large as those for bodyweight. Pras-AM exposure was greater in Asians than in Caucasians, but this appeared to result from a disproportionately greater exposure difference in Asian subjects with low bodyweight. Sex and allelic variation in CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C19, 2C9, 3A4 and 3A5 appeared to have no clinically relevant effect on Pras-AM exposure or IPA. Consistent with the lack of association between genetic status and these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results in healthy subjects, no significant association was detected between these allelic variants and the composite primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial. Studies in renally impaired subjects and subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment have indicated that dose adjustment is not required in these patient populations. Prasugrel has few clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Potent CYP3A inhibitors, gastric acid suppressants and food have been shown to reduce the rate of formation of Pras-AM but not its overall exposure. This pharmacokinetic effect reduced the rate of onset of IPA after a loading dose but did not affect the peak IPA after a loading dose or the IPA during maintenance dosing. Potent induction of CYP3A, as well as smoking--which induces CYP1A2--did not affect Pras-AM exposure or IPA. Prior treatment with clopidogrel did not influence tolerability to prasugrel and did not appear to alter IPA during prasugrel treatment. Prasugrel did not affect the activities of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or P-glycoprotein, but it weakly inhibited CYP2B6. The inhibition of CYP2B6 is potentially clinically significant only for drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window and have CYP2B6 as the primary elimination pathway. No interaction was detected between prasugrel and heparin. Although prasugrel did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics, prasugrel and warfarin should not be used together, because of an increased bleeding risk associated with their concomitant use."}

Her MPO-ANCA titer was 21 ELISA units (EUs) before PTU treatment but increased to 259 EUs at 22 days after PTU treatment. Her clinical condition improved with the discontinuation of PTU and with immunosuppressive therapy. This case indicated that MPO-ANCA vasculitis occurred within several weeks after the initiation of PTU and that this side effect could be caused by the change from MMI to PTU. Thus, our clinical observation suggests that patients treated with PTU should be carefully monitored for MPO-ANCA titers and variable manifestations of MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis regardless of the period of administration."}

Treatment of mice with trastuzumab (HER2 antibody) reduced HER2/p-MAPK but restored ER\u03b1 expression. The addition of trastuzumab to letrozole treatment when tumors progressed resulted in significantly longer tumor suppression than these drugs alone. Thus, inhibition of both HER2 and ER\u03b1 signaling pathways was necessary to overcome resistance. In ER\u03b1-negative tumors, the receptor has been shown to be silenced by epigenetic modifications. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 ER-negative tumors with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat (ENT) increased expression of ER\u03b1 and also aromatase. When ENT was combined with letrozole, tumor growth rate was markedly reduced compared with control tumors. ENT plus letrozole treatment also prevented the colonization and growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in the lung with significant reduction in visible and microscopic foci. These novel strategies could improve treatment for patients with acquired and innate resistance to AIs. "}

For most of these agents, recommendations regarding the use of pharmacokinetic parameters to establish individualised therapy cannot be made. The pharmacokinetics of antipneumocystis drugs are not well documented and clinical trials evaluating the relationship between the individual plasma pharmacokinetic profiles and responses to treatment are sparse. In clinical trials, the reduction of the daily dose of pentamidine to 3 or 2 mg/kg/day and of cotrimoxazole to 15 mg/kg of the trimethoprim component resulted in a substantial reduction of frequency and severity of adverse drug effects without diminishing efficacy. For pentamidine, a long half-life of > or = 4 days implies the need for a loading dose. Plasma concentrations of the parent drug at steady-state varied between 30 and 100 micrograms/L. The elimination pharmacokinetics are characterised by several elimination slopes indicating the existence of a deep peripheral compartment. Due to its very low renal clearance, dosage adjustments are not necessary in patients with renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of cotrimoxazole follow first-order kinetics in PCP and the particular parameters are similar to those reported in the treatment of bacterial infection. Steady-state plasma concentrations of both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole are attained within 2 to 3 days, but the range of 'therapeutic' plasma concentrations must be newly defined, since elevated trimethoprim concentrations could not be correlated with the frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions. The concentrations of sulphamethoxazole may be at least as important as those of trimethoprim in defining a toxic range. With dapsone/trimethoprim, clindamycin/primaquine and BW-566C (566 C 80) good clinical response rates were found in groups of patients with mild to moderate PCP. Comparative trials with standard drugs are still ongoing. Therapeutic to toxic concentration ratios have not been established in patients with PCP. Pharmacokinetic data pertaining to patients with PCP are either nonexistent or incomplete, or are complicated by a drug interaction between dapsone and trimethoprim suggesting an inhibition of metabolism of dapsone. Eflornithine and trimetrexate/calcium folinate have been used under specific research protocols, showing partial success as salvage agents for desperately ill patients with AIDS. Regarding all antipneumocystis drugs, additional clinical and pharmacokinetic data are needed to optimise and more fully individualise the treatment regimens for this severe infection."}

To optimally target novel pharmacotherapies, in addition to establishing the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of antipsychotics, the pathways underlying the most severe side effects must also be elucidated.

Wild-type (WT) and 5-HT(2A) knockout (KO) mice treated with haloperidol, clozapine, and risperidone were assessed for locomotor activity and catalepsy. WT mice showed a marked reduction in locomotor activity following acute administration of haloperidol and high-dose risperidone, which was most likely secondary to the severe catalepsy caused by these compounds. Clozapine also dramatically reduced locomotor activity, but in the absence of catalepsy. Interestingly, 5-HT(2A) KO mice were cataleptic following haloperidol and risperidone, but did not respond to clozapine's locomotor-suppressing effects. Restoration of 5-HT(2A) expression to cortical glutamatergic neurons re-instated the locomotor-suppressing effects of clozapine in the open field. In sum, we confirm that haloperidol and risperidone caused catalepsy in rodents, driven by strong antagonism of D\u2082. We also demonstrate that clozapine decreases locomotor activity in a 5-HT(2A)-dependent manner, in the absence of catalepsy. Moreover, we show that it is the cortical population of 5-HT(2A) that mediate the locomotor-suppressing effects of clozapine."}

Our third-generation study, done in conjunction with the Southeastern Cancer Study Group, tested the hypothesis of whether maintenance vinblastine was necessary to ensure optimal cure rates in disseminated testicular cancer. One hundred thirteen patients entered this maintenance study, and the results demonstrated that cure in a far-advanced cancer could be achieved with only 12 weeks of therapy (remission induction) because the relapse rate in such patients was only 7%. The cure rate for patients presenting with locoregional disease (Stages A and B) should approach 100%. Platinum, vinblastine, and bleomycin will regularly produce a 70% complete remission rate, and a further 10% of patients will be rendered NED with surgical resection of residual disease. The relapse rate with four courses of remission induction therapy in a large cooperative group study (Southeastern Cancer Study Group) was only 7%. The high success rate in disseminated disease has allowed the option of high cure rate in Stage B disease (positive retroperitoneal nodes) with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. At Indiana University, 137 patients have been followed with Stage A and B nonseminomatous testicular cancer from 1973 to 1979 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years, and currently 135 are alive and well.

The hypothesis was that the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist activity of buspirone would attenuate the rate-decreasing effects of nicotine. When administered alone, buspirone (0.3-10mg/kg) and (-)-nicotine (0.1-3.0mg/kg) decreased response rates in a dose-related manner, with ED(50) values (+/-95% C.L.) of 3.0 (1.7-5.1) mg/kg and 1.0 (0.7-1.5) mg/kg, respectively. Low doses of buspirone (0.3-1.0mg/kg) did not significantly shift the nicotine dose-response function, while doses of buspirone (3.0-10mg/kg) that produced rate-decreasing effects shifted the nicotine dose-response function to the left. There was no significant statistical interaction between buspirone and nicotine indicating that the shifts in the nicotine dose-response function were parallel. The buspirone analog gepirone (0.3-10mg/kg), which like buspirone is a serotonin (5-HT(1A)) agonist, but unlike buspirone is relatively devoid of D2 antagonist activity, was also tested in combination with nicotine. Gepirone was less potent in decreasing response rates compared with buspirone, with an ED(56) value of 4.5 (3.1-6.7) mg/kg. Rate-decreasing doses of gepirone (3.0-10mg/kg) in combination with nicotine resulted in parallel shifts to the left of the nicotine dose-response function. There was no statistically significant difference between the effects of buspirone and those of gepirone on the nicotine dose-response function. Isobolograms indicated that the pharmacological interactions between buspirone or gepirone and nicotine were not different from additivity.

Recent evidence suggests that paclitaxel, alone or in combination with other drugs, can be effectively used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). This study investigated whether resveratrol can sensitize NHL and MM cell lines to paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis and to delineate the underlying molecular mechanism of sensitization. Both resveratrol and paclitaxel negatively modulated tumor cell growth by arresting the cells at the G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle. Low concentrations of resveratrol exerted a sensitizing effect on drug-refractory NHL and MM cells to apoptosis induced by paclitaxel. Resveratrol selectively down-regulated the expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-x(L) and myeloid cell differentiation factor-1 (Mcl-1) and up-regulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins Bax and apoptosis protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1). Paclitaxel down-regulated the expression of Bcl-x(L), Mcl-1, and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 antiapoptotic proteins and up-regulated Bid and Apaf-1. Combination treatment resulted in apoptosis through the formation of tBid, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytosolic release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, activation of the caspase cascade, and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase. Combination of resveratrol with paclitaxel had minimal cytotoxicity against quiescent and mitogenically stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Inhibition of Bcl-x(L) expression by resveratrol was critical for chemosensitization and its functional impairment mimics resveratrol-mediated sensitization to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of Bcl-x(L) expression by resveratrol was due to the inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway and diminished activator protein-1-dependent Bcl-x(L) expression. The findings by resveratrol were corroborated with inhibitors of the ERK1/2 pathway. This study demonstrates that in resistant NHL and MM cell lines resveratrol and paclitaxel selectively modify the expression of regulatory proteins in the apoptotic signaling pathway and the combination, via functional complementation, results in synergistic apoptotic activity."}

Calcium lactate also reduced the BrdU incorporation by 48% and 51% respectively. Exposure of magnesium hydroxide or calcium lactate alone had no influence on BrdU incorporation. The results suggest that magnesium hydroxide might exert anti-carcinogenic effects as does calcium by reducing increased cell proliferation of colonic epithelium induced by toxic effects of bile acids, which are regarded as colon tumor promoters or cocarcinogens."}

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis is characterized by insidious onset and potentially blinding chronic anterior uveitis. Periodic ophthalmologic screening is of utmost importance for early diagnosis of uveitis. Early diagnosis and proper immunomodulatory treatment are essential for good visual prognosis. The goal of treatment is to achieve enduring drug-free remission. The choice of therapeutic regimen needs to be tailored to each individual case. One must keep in mind that patients under immunomodulatory treatment should be monitored closely due to possible side effects. Local and systemic corticosteroids have long been the mainstay of therapy; however, long-term corticosteroid therapy should be avoided due to serious side effects. Steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of JIA-associated uveitis include antimetabolites and biologic agents in refractory cases. Among the various immunomodulatory agents, methotrexate is generally the first choice, as it has a well-established safety and efficacy profile in pediatric cases and does not appear to increase the risk of cancer.

The incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was very low with both zolmitriptan (0.9%) and the combination regimen (1.5%); the latter percentage included 1 patient who withdrew from the study due to phlebitis, which was classified as a serious adverse event. This study showed that zolmitriptan is effective and well tolerated for the acute treatment of moderate to severe migraine.

In contrast, enalaprilat (10 nM-10 microM) caused no reduction in NA efflux until at a high concentration (10 microM, NA efflux reduced by about 20%). Moreover, the prodrugs ramipril and enalapril (added to the perfusion medium) were without any significant effects on ischemia-induced NA release. Both the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin (0.1 microM) and bradykinin (0.1 and 1 nM) caused marked reductions in ischemic NA efflux. However, when indomethacin (10 microM) was added to the perfusion medium, the effects of bradykinin (1 nM) and ramiprilat (26 nM) on NA efflux were abolished. Likewise, in the presence of angiotensin II (0.1 microM) the effect of ramiprilat was no longer evident. The magnitude of cellular injury, expressed as efflux of creatine kinase during reperfusion, was reduced by bradykinin (0.1 and 1 nM) and by ramiprilat (by about 55% at 2.6 microM). It is concluded that ramiprilat, at therapeutically relevant concentrations, attenuates the ischemia-induced mobilization of NA via a reduction in local angiotensin II production and/or bradykinin degradation. The lack of effect of enalaprilat in this model may reflect differences between converting enzyme inhibitors regarding tissue accumulation or the potency of local enzyme inhibition."}

CD95 (Y232F, Y291F) was not tyrosine phosphorylated and was unable to localize plasma membrane or induce autophagy. Knockdown/knockout of Src family kinases abolished sorafenib-induced CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, DISC formation, and the induction of cell death and autophagy. Knockdown of platelet-ived growth factor receptor-beta enhanced Src Y416 and CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation, which correlated with elevated CD95 plasma membrane levels and autophagy, and with a reduced ability of sorafenib to promote CD95 membrane localization. Vorinostat increased reactive oxygen species levels, and in a delayed NF kappa B-dependent fashion, those of FAS ligand and CD95. Neutralization of FAS-L did not alter the initial rapid drug-induced activation of CD95; however, neutralization of FAS-L reduced sorafenib + vorinostat toxicity by approximately 50%. Thus, sorafenib contributes to CD95 activation by promoting receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas vorinostat contributes to CD95 activation via the initial facilitation of reactive oxygen species generation and subsequently of FAS-L expression."}

This observation is the basis for the present study designed to validate the 6 Hz seizure as a model of therapy-resistant epilepsy. The pharmacological profile of the 6 Hz seizure was determined at varying current intensities using seven established AEDs (phenytoin, carbamazepine, clonazepam, phenobarbital, ethosuximide, trimethadione, valproic acid) and five second-generation AEDs (lamotrigine, levetiracetam, felbamate, tiagabine, topiramate). The immediate early gene c-Fos was used as a marker of seizure-induced neuronal activation to help define those brain structures that were activated by 6 Hz corneal stimulation. At the current intensity required to produce a seizure in 97% of the population (CC97=22 mA), the 6 Hz seizure did not discriminate between clinical classes of AEDs tested. Increasing the current intensity by 50% (i.e. 32 mA) decreased the sensitivity of the 6 Hz seizure to phenytoin and lamotrigine. At a current intensity of 2 x CC97 (i.e. 44 mA), only two AEDs, levetiracetam and valproic acid, displayed complete protection against the 6 Hz seizure, though the efficacy of these drugs was reduced when compared to the lower stimulation intensities. Intense c-Fos staining from 6 Hz seizures induced by 22 and 32 mA stimulus intensities remained localized to the amygdala and piriform cortex. Increasing the stimulus intensity to 44 mA resulted in additional heavy staining of the dentate gyrus. This recruitment of the dentate gyrus may account for the decrease in potency of levetiracetam and valproic acid at 44 mA. The pharmacological results combined with the c-Fos immunohistochemistry suggest that the 6 Hz stimulation may provide a useful model of therapy-resistant limbic seizures."}

Myocardial endothelin-1 and norepinephrine levels at the remote zone revealed a significant elevation in control infarcted rats, compared with sham-operated rats, which is consistent with sympathetic hyperinnervation after infarction. Sympathetic hyperinnervation was blunted after giving the rats either E2 or bosentan, assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase, growth-associated protein 43 and neurofilament, and Western blotting and real-time quantitative RT-PCR of nerve growth factor. Arrhythmic scores during programmed stimulation in E2-treated infarcted rats were significantly lower than in control-infarcted rats. Addition of bosentan did not have additional beneficial effects, compared with rats treated with E2 alone. The beneficial effect of E2 on sympathetic hyperinnervation was abolished by tamoxifen. Our data indicated that E2 has a role for sympathetic hyperinnervation after infarction, probably through an endothelin-1-depedent pathway. Chronic administration of E2 after infarction may attenuate the arrhythmogenic response to programmed electrical stimulation."}

Furthermore, docetaxel and bortezomib-treated cells exhibited marked changes in the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL."}

To discover small molecules that induce BMP-2, a luciferase reporter vector containing the 5'-flanking promoter region of the human BMP-2 gene was constructed and transfected into human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells. By the screening of an in-house natural product library with stably transfected HOS cells, a fungal metabolite, compactin, known as an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, was isolated. The stimulation of the promoter activity by compactin seemed to be specific for BMP-2 gene in HOS cells, since it had little effect on BMP-4 or SV40 promoter activity and the stimulation was not observed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. RT-PCR analysis and alkaline phosphatase assay revealed that compactin induced an increase in the expression of BMP-2 mRNA and protein. Like compactin, simvastatin also activated the BMP-2 promoter, whereas pravastatin did not. The statin-mediated activation of BMP-2 promoter was completely inhibited by the downstream metabolite of HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate, indicating that the activation was a result of the inhibition of the enzyme. These results suggest that statins, if they are selectively targeted to bone, have beneficial effects in the treatment of osteoporosis or bone fracture."}

The cisplatin and carboplatin effect on accumulation of MDR doxorubicin in cells of non-small cell cancer was studied by flow cytometry with the use of biopsy specimens.

The MDR phenotypes, i.e. Pgp-MRP+ or Pgp+MRP+, were detected in all the tumors investigated. Two types of changes in doxorubicin intracellular accumulation under the action of the inhibitors and the platinum drugs were shown: (a) an increase in doxorubicin cytoplasmic accumulation and (b) a change in subcellular distribution of the anthracycline (increased accumulation of doxorubicin in the cell nucleus and its higher binding to DNA).

Pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with tamoxifen, a novel antitumor fusicoccin derivative (ISIR-042), and anticancer drugs, and their effects on cell growth, signaling and gene expression were determined. Xenografts of Panc-1 cells were treated with tamoxifen, ISIR-042 and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) to determine the effects on tumor growth. The inhibition of the growth of pancreatic cancer cells induced by tamoxifen was effectively reduced by \u03b1-tocopherol, a membrane stabilizer. ISIR-042 produced synergistic effects with tamoxifen in inhibiting cell growth. Tamoxifen elevated lipid peroxidation and the release of cytochrome c, and these effects of tamoxifen were reduced by \u03b1-tocopherol. ISIR-042 significantly inhibited colony formation and the expression of stemness-related genes of pancreatic cancer cells. The triple combination of tamoxifen, ISIR-042, and 5FU or gemcitabine was effective at inhibiting cell growth and the appearance of drug-resistant cells. This combined treatment significantly inhibited the growth of Panc-1 cells as xenografts without apparent adverse effects. The triple combination of tamoxifen and ISIR-042 with 5FU or gemcitabine may be highly effective against pancreatic cancer by overcoming resistance to therapy."}

Two immunotherapeutic strategies have been applied, isolated or in combination, either with each other or with other agents with demonstrated efficacy in this scenario that would play a role as immunomodulators: vaccines or monoclonal antibodies aimed to block immune response checkpoint inhibitors. Although CRPC presents, a priori, characteristics suggesting that immunotherapy may play a relevant role as a therapeutic strategy, its clinical application has demonstrated a limited and heterogeneous activity, in terms of proportion of responders and response intensity. Generally, the objective response rate is very low, although, in patients who have response it is possible to detect a clear, long-lasting benefit. Only the autologous vaccine Sipuleucel T has demonstrated an overall survival increase in patients with good prognosis criteria. In these treatments, it is characteristic that no progression free survival increase is visible due to its action mechanism. PSA evolution may not be considered a surrogate variable of radiological response or clinical benefit in this environment either. It is necessary to identify what patient's or tumor's characteristics are able to maximize the response. An important limitation is the absence of response predictive biomarkers that serve for patient preselection. As a general rule, the best responses with isolated immunotherapeutic treatments have been observed in patients with low tumor load, which may suggest that their optimal application could be in earlier phases of the disease (high risk localized, biochemical failure, etc) Combination strategy, without doubt the one with best future, is based on additional treatments increasing cell lysis with the subsequent antigen exposure and/ or producing an immunomodulatory effect that can surmount tumor induced immunologic tolerance. The results obtained suggest that immunotherapy may be more effective in combined therapy with other active therapies (abiraterone, enzalutamide, Radium 223, docetaxel) in a fight to achieve disease chronification."}

A similar approach against the epidermal growth factor receptor is under evaluation in clinical trials. Various methods of inhibiting intracellular signal transduction also are in clinical development. These include tyrosine kinase inhibition, dominant negative mutant inhibitors of GRB-2, farnesyl transferase inhibition and vaccines directed against various epitopes expressed by mammary cancer cells. Angiogenesis and the enzyme telomerase are other targets under intense scrutiny since they are integrally involved with metastases and cellular immortality, both common characteristics of the malignant cell.

Duration of netilmicin therapy ranged from six to 13 days (mean 8.7 days) for od-treated patients and from seven to 16 days (mean 8.8 days) for tid-treated patients. Concomitant metronidazole was administered to 41 patients of the od group and 34 of the tid group; one patient in the tid group received clindamycin. Clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed, and peak and trough serum netilmicin levels were measured periodically, during therapy. Laboratory tests, including determinations of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values, were performed throughout the trial. A clinical cure was achieved in 57/57 od-treated patients and 54/55 tid-treated patients; treatment failed in one tid-treated patient (1/55). In od and tid groups, 86/86 and 80/81 netilmicin-susceptible pathogens initially isolated were considered to be eliminated, respectively; one isolate (Esch. coli) persisted in the tid group. Mean peak serum netilmicin concentration in the od group was approximately two-fold greater than that in the tid group; mean trough serum netilmicin concentrations were similar for the two groups. Adverse reactions were limited to mild pain at the site of netilmicin administration in several patients in each treatment group. Netilmicin od and tid (alone or in combination with metronidazole) were similarly efficacious in the treatment of patients with appendicitis and other intra-abdominal infections caused by netilmicin-susceptible pathogens. Both dosage regimens of netilmicin were safe and well tolerated."}

Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy is well known. HBV reactivation in patients with HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection caused by direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has also recently been reported. We report a case of acute hepatitis B in a patient with HCV infection after DAA therapy. An 83-year-old woman was referred for chronic hepatitis C. She was infected with HCV genotype 1b and negative for HBsAg at baseline. She received daclatasvir and asunaprevir therapy, and HCV became negative at 4\u00a0weeks and remained negative until 6\u00a0months after the end of DAA therapy. Acute hepatitis B developed 5\u00a0months after ending DAA therapy. Genome sequencing revealed the subgenotype as B1, and the serological subtype as adr. T118\u00a0K mutation at the S region as an immune escape mutant was identified. These virologic features led to HBV reactivation. The presence of hepatitis B core antibody or HBs antibody was not determined before DAA therapy, so prior HBV infection status was unclear. This case is speculated to represent HBV reactivation in a patient with previously resolved HBV induced by DAA therapy, based on virologic analysis and clinical status. The risk might be very low, but DAA therapy can cause HBV reactivation in chronic hepatitis C patients with prior HBV infection. When acute hepatitis emerges in patients who have received DAA therapy for HCV, HBV reactivation should be considered to allow early initiation of anti-HBV therapy. "}

The TAX327 trial compared weekly docetaxel, every-3-weeks (Q3W) docetaxel, and Q3W mitoxantrone plus prednisone in 1,006 patients with HRPC, and results demonstrated that survival was significantly longer with a docetaxel-based regimen than with mitoxantrone. That trial demonstrated that only Q3W docetaxel was significantly superior to mitoxantrone with respect to overall survival. Quality of life was also superior in the docetaxel groups. In the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 9916 trial, 674 men with progressive HRPC were randomized to 3-week cycles of docetaxel plus estramustine or mitoxantrone plus prednisone. Overall and disease-free survival times were significantly longer in the docetaxel arm. Collectively, the results of these trials demonstrate that survival can be significantly improved with chemotherapy in patients with HRPC to an extent that is comparable with the survival benefits seen in other cancers considered sensitive to chemotherapy such as breast cancer. Among various research tasks in HRPC is the definition of potential surrogate end points for survival, which will facilitate the conduct of pivotal trials. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and changes in PSA constructs (i.e., PSA doubling time and PSA velocity) are promising potential surrogate end points for future trials and are being actively evaluated at the present time. Until there is clear demonstration of a surrogate role for these alternative end points, survival remains the appropriate end point for phase III trials in HRPC. There is a need for safe and effective second- and third-line regimens for patients progressing after docetaxel, and these patients should enter clinical trials designed for this population. Mitoxantrone, vinorelbine, the platinum analogue satraplatin, and epothilone are among compounds that require careful testing in this setting. The addition of targeted therapies, such as the endothelin receptor antagonist, atrasentan, and angiogenesis inhibitors, such as thalidomide and bevacizumab, to docetaxel-based therapy is being evaluated. High-dose calcitriol may also be an effective addition to docetaxel. The extensive effort devoted to the evaluation of chemotherapy and other systemic modalities of treatment of HRPC is likely to yield additional clinical benefit for patients, making HRPC a more manageable, less lethal, and less debilitating disease."}

In vitro studies examining the effects of imatinib plus cytarabine (Ara-C) using CML cell lines and colony-forming assays of CML patient samples have shown synergistic antiproliferative effects of this combination. Thus several groups decided to investigate this new combination with the hypothesis that cell resistance would be less frequent. The CML French Group performed a phase II trial to determine the safety and tolerability of a combination of imatinib and Ara-C for previously untreated patients with chronic-phase CML. Treatment was administered on 28-day cycles for 12 months. Patients were treated continuously with imatinib orally at a dose of 400 mg daily. Ara-C was given on days 14 to 28 of each cycle at an initial dose of 20 mg/m(2)/d via subcutaneous injection, hydroxyurea (HU) being stopped at least 7 days before imatinib. Recently, the Dutch group decided to explore a combination of high-dose Ara-C with imatinib in patients in chronic-phase CML. Preliminary results are encouraging.

It is classified into three main subtypes: estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study has evaluated the effects of aspirin and metformin, isolated or in a combination, in breast cancer cells of the different subtypes. Methods The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3 were treated with aspirin and/or metformin (0.01\u00a0mM - 10\u00a0mM); functional in vitro assays were performed. The interactions with the estrogen receptors (ER) were evaluated in silico. Results Metformin (2.5, 5 and 10\u00a0mM) altered the morphology and reduced the viability and migration of the ER+ cell line MCF-7, whereas aspirin triggered this effect only at 10\u00a0mM. A synergistic effect for the combination of metformin and aspirin (2.5, 5 or 10\u00a0mM each) was observed in the TNBC cell subtype MDA-MB-231, according to the evaluation of its viability and colony formation. Partial inhibitory effects were observed for either of the drugs in the HER2+ cell subtype SK-BR-3. The effects of metformin and aspirin partly relied on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) upregulation, without the production of lipoxins. In silico, metformin and aspirin bound to the ER\u03b1 receptor with the same energy. Conclusion We have provided novel evidence on the mechanisms of action of aspirin and metformin in breast cancer cells, showing favorable outcomes for these drugs in the ER+ and TNBC subtypes."}

Pharmacokinetic data from these patients demonstrated that high concentrations of mitoxantrone were achievable in vivo to levels that were extremely cytotoxic in vitro. Subsequently, in a phase II study, 45 patients with untreated acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) under the age of 60 received mitoxantrone 80 mg/m2 in combination with cytarabine 3 g/m2 daily for 5 days and etoposide 150 mg/m2 for 3 days.

In a second AML study, 54 adults over the age of 60 with untreated AML were randomized to receive either high-dose or standard-dose mitoxantrone with cytarabine as a single induction regimen without consolidation. Patients receiving high-dose mitoxantrone did not experience increased morbidity or mortality compared with those given lower doses. Comparison of CR rates, disease-free and overall survival consistently favoured high-dose mitoxantrone, although the results did not achieve statistical significance. In patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), high-dose mitoxantrone with cytarabine was given as initial therapy in a phase II study involving 37 previously untreated adults. Results demonstrated that this dose-intensive regimen could produce a high CR rate (84%) with acceptable toxicity and compared favourably with experiences with vincristine/prednisone-based induction regimens. These studies demonstrate that high-dose mitoxantrone can be safely and effectively administered to patients with acute leukaemia and suggest that the incorporation of high doses of mitoxantrone into treatment regimens may lead to enhanced antileukaemic efficacy compared with standard doses.

In this report, using a cell line with knock-down p53 expression through siRNA, we found that amifostine enhancement of paclitaxel's anticancer effect is p53 status-dependent. Amifostine promotes entry into the G2-M phase through regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-1 activity in cells with dysfunctional p53, thereby enhancing cancer cell sensitivity to paclitaxel.

We found that gefitinib induced biphasic inhibition in over 50% of PDAC cells, with the initial growth inhibition occurring at nanomolar concentrations and a second growth inhibition occurring outside the clinical range. In contrast to gefitinib, cetuximab produced a single phase growth inhibition in a subset of PDAC cells. Using this sensitivity data, we screened for correlations between cell morphology proteins and EGFR ligands to EGFR inhibitor sensitivity, and found that mesothelin and the EGFR ligand TGF-\u03b1 have a strong correlation to gefitinib and cetuximab sensitivity. Analysis of downstream signaling pathways indicated that plc-\u03b31 and c-myc were consistently inhibited by EGFR inhibitor treatment in sensitive cell lines. While an inconsistent additive effect was observed with either cetuximab or gefitinib in combination with gemcitabine, the cell pathway data indicated consistent ERK activation, leading us to pursue EGFR inhibitors in combination with trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor. Both cetuximab and gefitinib in combination with trametinib produced an additive effect in all EGFR sensitive cell lines.

The antitumor activity was estimated by weighing the solid tumor on the 15th day after Ehrlich ascites cell inoculation. Pentobarbital induced sleeping time for monitoring the activity of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes was defined as the time between the loss and the recovery of the righting reflex. Consecutive administration of pentobarbital shortened the pentobarbital sleeping time and increased the antitumor activity after cyclophosphamide.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved regulator of the cellular response to the presence of low energy in all eukaryotic cells. It is considered a key sensor of the balance of cellular ATP and AMP concentrations. LKB1 serine/threonine kinase is a divergent yet evolutionarily well-conserved kinase, biochemically sufficient to activate AMPK in vitro and genetically required for AMPK activation. Because of this potent connection to AMPK, LKB1 may act as a central regulator of metabolism in vivo. Once activated, AMP kinase phosphorylates the transcriptional activator TorC2, thereby blocking its nuclear translocation and inhibiting the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis. Data suggest that LKB1/AMPK signaling plays a role in protection from apoptosis, specifically in response to agents that increase the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. Active AMPK signaling offers a protective effect by providing the cell with time to reverse the aberrantly high ratio of AMP/ATP. If unable to reverse this ratio, the cell will eventually undergo cell death. These observations offer the provocative suggestion of a potential therapeutic window in which LKB1-deficient tumor cells may be acutely sensitive to AMP analogues or sensitized to cell death by other stimuli when treated in combination with agents that increase the AMP/ATP ratio. LKB1 therefore is a classical tumor suppressor. AMPK is a direct LKB1 substrate. A consequence of AMPK activation by LKB1 is the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C1 pathway. Metformin's anti-cancerous properties have been demonstrated in various cancer cells in vitro, such as lung, pancreatic, colon, ovarian, breast, prostate, renal cancer cells, melanoma, and even in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To test metformin's action in vivo, mice were implanted with transformed mammary epithelial cells and treated with three cycles of metformin and with the anthracycline doxorubicin. When combined with doxorubicin, metformin wiped out tumors and prevented recurrence. Metformin alone had no effect, and doxorubicin as a single agent initially shrank tumors, but they regrew later. Virtually no cancer stem cells were recovered immediately after treatment and the complete response was sustained for nearly two months. Further studies are needed to assess the anti-cancerous potentials of metformin in vivo. This article reviews the current knowledge on the actions of LKB1/AMPK and the effectiveness of metformin in cancer, specifically in diabetes patients. "}

The purpose of this Phase 2 study was to evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in patients with unresectable Stage III or IV melanoma receiving a combination of YM155 plus docetaxel. The study had two parts: Part 1 established the dose of docetaxel that was tolerable in combination with YM155, and Part 2 evaluated the tolerable docetaxel dose (75 mg/m(2) ) in combination with YM155 (5 mg/m(2) per day continuous infusion over 168 h every 3 weeks).

Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), 1-year overall survival (OS) rate, time from first response to progression, clinical benefit rate (CBR), and safety. Sixty-four patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with docetaxel and YM155. Eight patients received an initial docetaxel dose of 100 mg/m(2) and 56 patients received 75 mg/m(2) of docetaxel. Six-month PFS rate per Independent Review Committee (IRC) was 34.8% (n = 64; 95% CI, 21.3-48.6%), and per Investigator was 31.3% (n = 64; 95% CI, 19.5-43.9%).

Our previous studies indicated that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor or octreotide could suppress the proliferation of gastric adenocarcinoma in vitro or in vivo. The present study was aimed to find whether rofecoxib combined with octreotide could enhance the inhibitive effects on the growth of gastric cancer. The effect of rofecoxib or octreotide on proliferation of gastric cancer cell line was determined by 3H-thymidine ribotide incorporation. The TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay was used to detect the apopotosis. To determine their synergic antineoplastic effects, the interaction between rofecoxib and octreotide on SGC-7901 cell was evaluated by the median effect plot. After orthotopical implantion of xenografts of human gastric cancer in stomach, nude mice were given rofecoxib plus octreotide for 8 weeks. Cyclooxygenase-2 in gastric cancer tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry. Combination of rofecoxib and octreotide presented synergistic effect (combination index < 1) in the majority of responses. The inhibitory rate for xenografts in nude mice was 89.7% in rofecoxib group. Combination of rofecoxib and octreotide enhanced inhibitory rate to 98.8%. The combination greatly increased the apoptotic index (78.20% +/- 6.45%) of the xenografts as compared with that of using rofecoxib alone (46.60% +/- 3.42%); the difference was very significant (p < 0.001). Rofecoxib could inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase-2 in the tissue of gastric adenocarcinomas of nude mice. Our results indicate that combination of rofecoxib and octreotide significantly enhances the antiproliferative effect in gastric adenocarcinoma, which might have potential therapeutic value."}

The effects of the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine on myocardial ischaemia and oedema evoked by endothelin-1 (ET-1) or IRL 1620, an ETB receptor-selective agonist were studied in anaesthetized and conscious rats. 2. Bolus injection of ET-1 (1 nmol kg-1, i.v.) or IRL 1620 (1 nmol kg-1, i.v.) to conscious chronically catheterized rats evoked a transient depressor response followed by a prolonged pressor effect. Corresponding to changes in blood pressure, a transient tachycardia and a sustained bradycardia were observed. Pretreatment of the animals with verapamil (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) or nifedipine (200 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) produced on average 5 mmHg decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. Both verapamil and nifedipine inhibited by 63 and 44% the pressor actions of ET-1 or IRL 1620 (1 nmol kg-1), respectively, and the accompanying bradycardia. Both verapamil and nifedipine potentiated the magnitude of the depressor action of ET-1 and IRL 1620 without affecting the accompanying tachycardia. Decreasing mean arterial blood pressure with hydralazine (0.2 - 0.3 micromol kg-1, i.v.) to levels comparable to those observed after verapamil or nifedipine had no significant effects on the haemodynamic responses to ET-1 or IRL-1620. 3. Intravenous bolus injection of ET-1 or IRL 1620 (0.1-2 nmol kg-1) into anaesthetized rats produced dose-dependent ST segment elevation of the electrocardiogram without causing arrhythmias. ST segment elevation developed within 30-50s and persisted for at least 10-20 min following injection of the peptides. 4. Pretreatment of the animals with verapamil (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) or nifedipine (200 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) inhibited on average by 79 and 76% the ST segment elevation elicited by ET-1 (1 nmol kg-1), respectively. Verapamil and nifedipine also attenuated IRL 1620 (1 nmol kg-1)-induced ST segment elevation on average by 71 and 74%, respectively. In contrast, no significant inhibition was observed with hydralazine (0.2-0.3 mumol kg-1). 5. Both ET-1 and, to a lesser extent, IRL 1620 (0.1-2 nmol kg-1) evoked albumin accumulation in cardiac tissues in a dose-dependent fashion as measured by the local extravascular accumulation of Evans blue dye in conscious rats. ET-1 and IRL 1620 (1 nmol kg-1) enhanced albumin extravasation by 109 and 82%, and 34 and 44% in the left ventricle and right atrium, respectively. ET-1 or IRL 1620-induced albumin extravasation was completely prevented by verapamil (1 mg kg-1) or nifedipine (200 micrograms kg-1) in these vascular beds. In contrast, hydralazine (0.2-0.3 mumol kg-1) failed to modify the effects of ET-1 or IRL 1620 on albumin extravasation. 6. These results show that verapamil and nifedipine are highly effective in protecting the myocardium against the pro-ischaemic and microvascular permeability enhancing effects of ET-1 and suggest that ETA and constrictor ETB (tentatively termed ETB2) receptors mediating these actions of ET-1 are coupled to calcium influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels."}

On a farm with a previous history of proliferative enteropathy outbreaks, 648 weaned piglets (23 days old) were divided into nine experimental groups according to bodyweight and sex ratio, each group comprising four pens with 18 pigs in each pen. One group served the trial as a negative (unmedicated) control: another (the positive control) received monensin via feed at 100 p.p.m. up to the end of the growing phase (107 days old) and 50 p.p.m. up to slaughter age (156 days old). The remaining seven groups were offered feed with the addition of the following antibiotics: virginia-mycin (50-20 p.p.m.), avilamycin (40-20 p.p.m.), spiramycin (50-20 p.p.m.), zinc bacitracin (50-10 p.p.m.), avoparcin (40-20 p.p.m.), tylosin (40-20 p.p.m.) and salinomycin (60-30 p.p.m.), respectively. The performance of the pigs in the positive control group was very satisfying and among the highest in the trial, verifying earlier field studies. As a general conclusion it seems that all tested growth promoters had a beneficial effect compared with the untreated control, indicated by the decrease of mortality rate, the elimination of diarrhoeal incidence and the enhancement of growth performance, although the proliferative enteropathy control achieved by each substance was not always satisfactory. More specifically, the antibiotic growth promoters tested can be scaled according to their total efficacy as follows: 1. Salinomycin, tylosin, spiramycin; 2. Virginiamycin, zinc bacitracin, avilamycin; and 3. Avoparcin. Finally, it is considered that part of the growth promotion efficacy of the tested substances is due to their potential capacity to control porcine intestinal adenomatosis; thus, in future growth performance trials, the disease background of the trial farms must be examined, especially for porcine enteropathy challenges."}

Lofexidine did not modify gastric secretion in rats. On the other hand, it inhibited chemically induced (phenylbutazone) and stress-induced (swimming) gastric ulcer formation in rats. Antiinflammatory and analgesic activities in rats and mice were, at most, very weak. Lofexidine increased blood glucose levels of normoglycaemic rats; clonidine is known to have the same effect. In order to investigate the possibility of combining lofexidine with a diuretic drug for the treatment of hypertension, the interaction with hydrochlorothiazide was studied in some experiments. The results obtained from these experiments showed that there was no adverse effect and the diuretic and saluretic effects of hydrochlorothiazide were not impaired. No findings militated against the use of lofexidine as an antihypertensive drug. It is likely that lofexidine, in contrast to clonidine, has less marked central sedative effects."}

Previous results from our preclinical studies have shown that lonidamine (LND) can positively modulate the antiproliferative activity of doxorubicin (DOX) on breast cancer cell lines. To evaluate the effect of LND in a clinical setting, a multicenter randomized trial was carried out on patients with advanced breast cancer. From September 1991 to July 1993, 181 patients were enrolled in the trial and received an initial treatment of DOX at 75 mg/m2 for 3 cycles. The 137 patients who reached complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease were randomized to receive either DOX alone (75 mg/m2 day 1) (arm A) or DOX plus LND (600 mg orally/day) (arm B). The patients enrolled in the two arms were fairly homogeneous in terms of major clinical characteristics. Toxicity was similar in both arms except for myalgia: WHO grade > or=2 was observed in 57% of arm B patients. Overall response rate to DOX + LND was 50% and to DOX alone 38% in evaluable patients, and 48% vs 37% in all registered patients, as determined by an intention-to-treat analysis. The differences did not reach statistical significance. Conversely, in agreement with previous findings, we observed a significant difference in response rate in the subgroup of patients with liver metastases, regardless of the extent of hepatic involvement (DOX + LND 68% vs DOX 33%, p=0.03). This observation makes LND an important tool in association with anthracyclines in the treatment of this subgroup of patients."}

We evaluated the safety and tolerability of the combination of enzalutamide, a novel androgen receptor (AR) antagonist with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a first-line treatment in advanced pancreatic cancer. Methods We used the standard 3\u2009+\u20093 dose escalation design with cohort expansion to evaluate 2 dose levels of enzalutamide: 80\u00a0mg and 160\u00a0mg/day orally (phase 1a) in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. In the expansion phase (phase 1b), AR+ was a pre-requisite criterion. We also evaluated the full pharmacokinetic (PK) profile for nab-paclitaxel and enzalutamide. Results We enrolled 24 patients, 12 patients in phase 1a and 12 patients in phase 1b. The median age was 68 (range, 32-84) years. No DLTs were observed. Grade 3/4 treatment related adverse events included neutropenia (44%), anemia (40%), leukopenia (24%), nausea and vomiting (20%), diarrhea (16%), infections (12%), thrombocytopenia (8%), thromboembolic event (8%), hypertension (8%), hypokalemia (8%), hyponatremia (8%), and ALT elevation (8%). Median overall survival and progression-free survival was 9.73 [95%CI:9.73-13.5] and 7.53 (95%CI:6.05-12.8) months, respectively. PK analysis suggests that the combination therapy does not impact the kinetics of either drug evaluated.

Colistin and ciprofloxacin were also co-sprayed with l-leucine in the mass ratio of 1:1:1. The physical and aerosolization stability of the selected co-sprayed formulations stored at 20, 55, and 75% relative humidity (RH) were examined. Formulation characterizations were carried out using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) for crystallinity, scanning electron microscopy for morphology and particle size distribution, and dynamic vapor sorption for moisture sorption. Particle surface analysis was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and nano-time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Potential intermolecular interactions were studied using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Aerosol performance was evaluated using a multistage liquid impinger with a RS01 monodose inhaler device. PXRD diffractograms showed that the co-spray-dried colistin-ciprofloxacin formulation in the mass ratio (1:1) was amorphous at 55% RH for up to 60 days; whereas the co-spray-dried colistin-ciprofloxacin (1:3) and colistin-ciprofloxacin (1:9) crystallized after storage for 3 days at 55% RH. However, the extent of crystallization for the combination formulations was less as compared to the spray-dried ciprofloxacin alone formulation. Surface morphology of the co-spray-dried formulations at different concentrations did not change even after storage at 55% RH for 60 days, unlike the spray-dried ciprofloxacin alone powder which became rougher after 3 days of storage at 55% RH. Surface analysis data indicated surface enrichment of colistin in the co-spray-dried formulations. Increasing colistin concentration on the composite particles surfaces improved aerosol performance of ciprofloxacin. FTIR data demonstrated intermolecular interactions between colistin and ciprofloxacin, thereby delaying and/or preventing crystallization of ciprofloxacin when co-spray-dried. Co-spray drying ciprofloxacin with colistin in the mass ratio (1:1) completely prevented crystallization of ciprofloxacin at 55% RH for up to 60 days. However, the colistin-ciprofloxacin formulation (1:1) began to fuse when stored at 75% RH due to moisture absorption resulting in a compromised aerosol performance. In contrast, the colistin-ciprofloxacin-leucine (1:1:1) formulation demonstrated no particle fusion, enabling a stable aerosol performance at 75% RH for 7 days. This study demonstrated that incorporation of colistin in the spray-dried formulations can improve physical stability and aerosolization of amorphous ciprofloxacin at 55% RH. At 75% RH, further addition of l-leucine in the formulation prevented particle fusion and deterioration in aerosol performance, attributed to the enrichment of nonhygroscopic l-leucine on the particle surface."}

The clinical application of gemcitabine is supported by a favorable toxicity profile. In metastatic breast cancer, several Phase II trials document the activity of gemcitabine in pretreated and unpretreated patients. In a single Phase III trial performed in elderly patients not pretreated, gemcitabine was inferior to epirubicin. High activity has, however, been obtained by the combination of gemcitabine with taxanes such as paclitaxel or docetaxel. In a randomized trial performed in anthracycline-pretreated patients, the combined use of gemcitabine and paclitaxel induced a significant improvement not only of response rate and time to disease progression, but also caused a significant increase in quality of life and survival when compared with paclitaxel alone. The combination of gemcitabine with vinorelbine and cisplatin has been validated in numerous Phase II trials and promises reliable activity in anthracycline- and/or taxane-pretreated patients. Triple-agent regimens such as gemcitabine/epirubicin/paclitaxel provided consistently high response rates in Phase II trials, but failed to show superiority over the 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide regimen in a randomized Phase III trial. Based on high response rates and pathological complete remission rates achieved by preoperative induction therapy with gemcitabine/epirubicin/taxane regimens, ongoing trials focus on the incorporation of gemcitabine into neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimens."}

Low brain accumulation of anticancer drugs due to efflux transporters may limit chemotherapeutic efficacy, necessitating a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. P-glycoprotein (Abcb1a/1b) and breast cancer resistance protein (Abcg2) combination knockout mice often display disproportionately increased brain accumulation of shared drug substrates compared with single transporter knockout mice. Recently developed pharmacokinetic models could explain this phenomenon. To experimentally test these models and their wider relevance for tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other drugs, we selected dasatinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib because of their divergent oral availability and brain accumulation profiles: the brain accumulation of dasatinib is mainly restricted by Abcb1, that of sorafenib mainly by Abcg2, and that of sunitinib equally by Abcb1 and Abcg2. We analyzed the effect of halving the efflux activity of these transporters at the blood-brain barrier by generating heterozygous Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2 knockout mice and testing the plasma and brain levels of the drugs after oral administration at 10 mg/kg. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the \u223c2-fold decreased expression of both transporters in brain. Interestingly, whereas complete knockout of the transporters caused 24- to 36-fold increases in brain accumulation of the drugs, the heterozygous mice only displayed 1.6- to 1.9-fold increases of brain accumulation relative to wild-type mice. These results are well in line with the predictions of the pharmacokinetic models and provide strong support for their validity for a wider range of drugs. Moreover, retrospective analysis of fetal accumulation of drugs across the placenta in Abcb1a/1b heterozygous knockout pups suggests that these models equally apply to the maternal-fetal barrier. "}

Here, we show that acetazolamide derivatives, which bind to carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) on the surface of kidney cancer cells, selectively deliver payloads at the site of disease, sparing normal organs. Biodistribution studies, performed in tumor-bearing mice with acetazolamide derivatives bearing a technetium-99m chelator complex or a red fluorophore as payload, revealed a preferential tumor accumulation of the compound at doses up to 560 nmol/kg. The percentage of injected dose per gram in the tumor was dose-dependent and revealed optimal tumor:organ ratios at 140 nmol/kg, with a tumor:blood ratio of 80:1 at 6 hours. Acetazolamide, coupled to potent cytotoxic drugs via a dipeptide linker, exhibited a potent antitumor activity in nude mice bearing SKRC-52 renal cell carcinomas, whereas drug derivatives devoid of the acetazolamide moiety did not exhibit any detectable anticancer activity at the same doses. The observation of tumor regression with a noninternalizing ligand and with different cytotoxic moieties (MMAE and PNU-159682) indicates a general mechanism of action, based on the selective accumulation of the product on tumor cells, followed by the extracellular proteolytic release of the cytotoxic payload at the neoplastic site and the subsequent drug internalization into tumor cells. Acetazolamide-based drug conjugates may represent a promising class of targeted agents for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer, as the majority of human clear cell renal cell carcinomas are strongly positive for CAIX.

Here, we used an in vivo xenograft model of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer with HER-2/neu overexpression (MCF7/HER-2/neu-18) to investigate mechanisms of growth inhibition and treatment resistance. MCF7/HER-2/neu-18 tumors were growth inhibited by estrogen deprivation and with fulvestrant, but resistance developed in 2 to 3 months. Inhibited tumors had reductions in ER, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), phosphorylated HER-2/neu (p-HER-2/neu), and phosphorylated p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MAPK). p27 was increased especially in tumors sensitive to estrogen deprivation. Tumors with acquired resistance to these therapies had complete loss of ER, increased p-HER-2/neu, increased p-MAPK, and reduced p27. In contrast, IGF-IR and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels were markedly reduced in these resistant tumors. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, which can block EGFR/HER-2/neu signaling, significantly delayed the emergence of resistance to both estrogen deprivation and fulvestrant. Levels of p-MAPK and p-AKT decreased with gefitinib, whereas high ER levels were restored. Eventually, however, tumors progressed in mice treated with gefitinib combined with estrogen deprivation or fulvestrant accompanied again by loss of ER and IGF-IR, increased p-HER-2/neu, high p-MAPK, and now increased p-AKT. Thus, estrogen deprivation and fulvestrant can effectively inhibit HER-2/neu-overexpressing tumors but resistance develops quickly. EGFR/HER-2/neu inhibitors can delay resistance, but reactivation of HER-2/neu and signaling through AKT leads to tumor regrowth. Combining endocrine therapy with EGFR/HER-2/neu inhibitors should be tested in clinical breast cancer, but a more complete blockade of EGFR/HER-2/neu may be optimal."}

We compared antiarrhythmic and electrophysiologic effects observed when quinidine or its stereoisomer quinine were combined with mexiletine. Quinine and quinidine both prolong conduction time; however, these agents have divergent effects on ventricular repolarization time and refractoriness. The modest prolongation of conduction time observed with quinine and mexiletine-quinine in the absence of change of ventricular refractoriness was not associated with antiarrhythmic efficacy. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of mexiletine-quinidine exceeds that of mexiletine-quinine, suggesting that the ability of quinidine to prolong refractoriness and repolarization contributes to the antiarrhythmic efficacy of mexiletine-quinidine. Although, both the mexiletine-quinidine combination and quinidine monotherapy prolonged refractoriness to a similar extent, the mexiletine-quinidine combination produced greater antiarrhythmic efficacy and prolonged interventricular conduction within the periinfarct zone to an extent greater than did quinidine alone.

Here we demonstrate acquired resistance to TAE684 and LDK378 in ALK(F1174L)-driven human NB cells that is linked to overexpression and activation of the AXL tyrosine kinase and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). AXL phosphorylation conferred TAE684 resistance to NB cells through upregulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Inhibition of AXL partly rescued TAE684 resistance, resensitizing these cells to this compound. AXL activation in resistant cells was mediated through increased expression of the active form of its ligand, GAS6, that also served to stabilize the AXL protein. Although ectopic expression of AXL and TWIST2 individually in TAE684-sensitive parental cells led to the elevated expression of mesenchymal markers and invasive capacity, only AXL overexpression induced resistance to TAE684 as well. TAE684-resistant cells showed greater sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition than did their parental counterparts, with downregulation of AXL and AXL-mediated ERK signaling. Our studies indicate that aberrant AXL signaling and development of an EMT phenotype underlie resistance of ALK(F1174L)-driven NB cells to TAE684 and its derivatives. We suggest that the combination of ALK and AXL or HSP90 inhibitors be considered to delay the emergence of such resistance."}

Ivermectin was shown to be the most potent Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor of the macrocyclic lactones (IC(50)=7 microM). It appears to show a 'competitive' inhibition with respect to high concentrations of ATP by increasing the regulatory binding site K(m) but without affecting the catalytic site K(m). In addition, ivermectin stabilizes the ATPase in an E1 conformational state, and inhibits Ca(2+) release from the enzyme during turnover. This would suggest that ivermectin inhibits Ca(2+) release from the luminal binding sites of the phosphoenzyme intermediate, a step that is known to be accelerated by high [ATP]."}

Dabigatran (110 or 150\u2009mg twice daily) demonstrated noninferiority versus adjusted-dose warfarin with regard to the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (primary endpoint) in patients with AF in the RE-LY trial, and the 150\u2009mg twice-daily dosage was significantly more effective than warfarin for this endpoint, as well as most other efficacy endpoints. The incidence of major bleeding was generally similar in patients receiving dabigatran 150\u2009mg twice daily or warfarin, but was lower in patients receiving dabigatran 110\u2009mg twice daily. With regard to other bleeding endpoints, dabigatran was generally associated with lower rates than warfarin, except for gastrointestinal major bleeding. Dabigatran (both dosages) was associated with a higher incidence of dyspepsia than warfarin. Results of modelled cost-utility analyses from several countries from the perspective of a healthcare payer over a lifetime (or 20-year) time horizon and primarily based on data from the RE-LY trial were generally consistent. All but one analysis demonstrated that twice-daily dabigatran 150\u2009mg (or age-adjusted, sequential dosing) was cost effective with regard to the incremental cost per QALY gained relative to adjusted-dose warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in AF patients, as the results were below generally accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds. In contrast, the incremental cost per QALY gained for dabigatran 110\u2009mg twice daily versus warfarin exceeded cost-effectiveness thresholds in all studies except one. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the cost utility of dabigatran versus warfarin was generally robust to variations in the majority of parameters. However, the incremental cost per QALY gained for dabigatran versus warfarin improved when levels of international normalized ratio control in warfarin recipients decreased and when the baseline level of risk of stroke increased."}

The MTT assay was used to quantify the inhibitory effect of the drugs on total cells and stem cells specifically. Stem cell apoptosis, cell cycle distributions, and their tumorigenicity after treatment were investigated by flow cytometry or soft agar colony formation assays. For the in vivo studies, BALB/c mice were injected with BT474 stem cells, and the different treatments were administered. After necropsy, the expression of Ki67, CD31, AKT1, and phospho-AKT (Thr308) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. For the in vitro studies, Treatment with everolimus resulted in stem cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of everolimus with trastuzumab was more effective at inhibiting cell growth (P < 0.001) and tumorigenicity (P < 0.001) compared with single-agent therapy. In addition, an increase in G1 cell cycle arrest and an increased population of cells in early apoptosis were seen in the combination treatment group compared with either of the single-agent groups (P < 0.01). For the in vivo studies, everolimus plus trastuzumab therapy was much more effective at reducing tumor volume in mice compared with either single agent alone (P < 0.05). Compared with everolimus alone, the combination of everolimus and trastuzumab reduced the expression of Ki67, AKT1, and phospho-AKT (Thr308) (P < 0.05). We conclude that everolimus has effective inhibitory effects on HER2-overexpressing stem cells in vitro and vivo. Everolimus plus trastuzumab is a rational combination treatment that may be promising in human clinical trials."}

This is despite the fact that the optimal dose and formulation have yet to be determined. TAC can be applied painlessly to wounds and is about as effective as lidocaine infiltration for anesthetizing pediatric facial and scalp lacerations. It is relatively ineffective on lacerations located elsewhere or in adults. The most commonly used TAC solution contains high concentrations of cocaine, tetracaine, and epinephrine, drugs that individually can cause serious toxicity if absorbed in sufficient amounts. In addition, the three components of TAC may interact to potentiate their intrinsic toxicities. The deliberate and inadvertent application of TAC to mucous membranes has caused status epilepticus and two pediatric deaths. The risk of toxicity from misapplication of TAC is heightened because TAC is most effective and therefore most widely used on pediatric facial and scalp lacerations. Cocaine is also absorbed after TAC is applied to dermal lacerations and may cause toxicity by this route. Until additional research is performed to establish the minimum effective dose of TAC and its potential toxicity and until FDA approval is granted, we do not think that it can be recommended as the drug of choice for pediatric facial and scalp lacerations in the ED. If TAC is administered, a maximum dose of 2 to 3 mL of the \"half-strength\" formula proposed by Bonadio and Wagner should be used, and application should be performed by medical personnel, using a soaked gauze or cotton ball. Care should be taken to make sure none of the solution comes in contact with mucous membranes, and TAC should not be applied to lacerations involving the vermillion border of the lip or the lip itself. Close medical monitoring of the patient is essential to detect signs of toxicity. Research on other topical agents such as tetracaine with epinephrine is also needed. Although anesthetizing wounds painlessly remains a worthy goal, exposing patients to added and unknown risks and increasing the cost of health care is unacceptable."}

To reinvestigate this idea, in this study we used the radiolabeled microsphere technique to measure in vivo tissue blood flow before and at several time points after perisciatic nerve and intramasseter muscle injection of lidocaine alone, epinephrine, the selective alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine, or lidocaine combined with these adrenergic receptor agonists. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to assess significant changes in blood flow over time. Lidocaine (2, 10, and 20 mg/mL) and epinephrine (10 micro g/mL or 1:100,000) injected alone did not alter blood flow in sciatic nerve, perisciatic muscle, or masseter muscle. Injections of lidocaine (10 mg/mL) combined with epinephrine (10 micro g/mL) did not affect adjacent muscle blood flow but caused a mild reduction in sciatic nerve blood flow, which was significant 30 min after injection. However, phenylephrine (10 micro g/mL), a potent vasoconstrictor, combined with lidocaine (10 mg/mL) significantly reduced blood flow in all three tissues. Our findings suggest that mechanisms other than local vasoconstriction may contribute to the prolongation of lidocaine nerve blocks by epinephrine."}

During the course of the study, the serum creatinine concentration increased by more than 5 mg/l in only one patient (ticarcillin/clavulanate group). Two patients (one in each group) had apparent allergic reactions. No other drug-related adverse effects were noted. In-vitro sensitivity testing of anaerobic isolates revealed that, of those tested, 5/38, 1/38 and 2/37 were resistant to ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate and clindamycin, respectively. Among aerobic Gram-negative isolates, 34/78, 6/78 and 4/78 were resistant to ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, and gentamicin, respectively. Among aerobic Gram-positive isolates, 2/32, 2/32, and 5/14 were resistant to ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, and clindamycin, respectively.

Knock down of PKGI/II abolished the ability of sildenafil to enhance pemetrexed toxicity whereas pan-inhibition of NOS using L-NAME or knock down of [iNOS + eNOS] only partially reduced the lethal drug interaction. Pemetrexed reduced the ATPase activities of HSP90 and HSP70 in an ATM-AMPK-dependent fashion that was enhanced by sildenafil signaling via PKGI/II. The drug combination activated an ATM-AMPK-TSC2 pathway that was associated with reduced mTOR S2448 and ULK-1 S757 phosphorylation and increased ULK-1 S317 and ATG13 S318 phosphorylation. These effects were prevented by chaperone over-expression or by expression of an activated form of mTOR that prevented autophagosome formation and reduced cell killing.

During recent years their pharmacokinetic properties and metabolism have been studied in more detail. Although these 3 calcium antagonists exhibit great diversity in chemical structure, they exhibit common pharmacokinetic properties. These drugs are extensively metabolised and only traces of unchanged drugs are eliminated in urine. Their systemic plasma clearances are high and dependent on liver blood flow. Therefore, their bioavailabilities (diltiazem 40 to 50%; nifedipine 40 to 50%; verapamil 10 to 30%) are low despite almost complete absorption following oral administration. During long term treatment, oral clearance decreases and bioavailability increases due to saturation of hepatic first-pass metabolism. Pronounced intra- and inter-individual variations in clearance and bioavailability are observed. In patients with liver cirrhosis the various pharmacokinetic parameters are grossly altered. Clearance decreases, elimination half-life is substantially prolonged, and bioavailability more than doubles. In addition, the volume of distribution increases. Whereas renal disease has no impact on the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and verapamil, elimination half-life of nifedipine increases in relation to the degree of renal impairment due to an increase in volume of distribution. Systemic clearance, however, remains unchanged. The data so far available indicate that the plasma concentrations of these drugs correlate with both their electrophysiological and haemodynamic effects. However, no effective therapeutic plasma concentration range has been firmly established. As reliable clinical end-points are available for dose titration of calcium antagonists, it is doubtful whether therapeutic drug monitoring will be of great value. Calcium antagonists are often administered in combination with a variety of other drugs. Thus, the potential for both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic drug interaction exists. The interaction between digoxin and these drugs is of clinical importance. Verapamil and diltiazem cause a significant increase in plasma digoxin concentrations. In contrast, nifedipine does not lead to a significant increase in the plasma digoxin concentration. The mechanism responsible for this interaction is inhibition of both renal and non-renal digoxin clearance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}

This study was designed to determine the possible protective effect of mesna (2-Mercaptoethane Sulfonate) on renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Wistar albino rats were unilaterally nephrectomized, and 15 days later they were subjected to 45 min of renal pedicle occlusion followed by 6 h of reperfusion. Mesna (MESNA, 150 mg/kg, i.p.; an effective dose against I/R injury) or vehicle was administered twice, 15 min prior to ischemia and immediately before the reperfusion period. At the end of the reperfusion period, rats were killed by decapitation. Kidney samples were taken for histological examination or determination of the free radicals, renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Renal tissue collagen content, as a fibrosis marker was also determined. Creatinine and urea concentrations in blood were measured for the evaluation of renal function. The results demonstrated that renal I/R caused nephrotoxicity, as evidenced by increases in blood urea and creatinine levels, which was reversed by MESNA treatment. Increased free radical levels, as assessed by nitroblue-tetrazolium test were reduced with MESNA. Moreover, the decrease in GSH and increases in MDA levels, and MPO activity induced by I/R indicated that renal injury involves free radical formation. Treatment of rats with MESNA restored the reduced GSH levels while it decreased MDA levels as well as MPO activity. Increased collagen contents of the kidney tissues by I/R were reversed back to the control levels by MESNA treatment. Since MESNA administration reversed these oxidant responses, improved renal function and microscopic damage, it seems likely that MESNA protects kidney tissue against I/R induced oxidative damage."}

Mice infected with 10(5) Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi blood trypomastigotes and treated orally with 30 mg of ketoconazole per kg of body weight per day for 7 days, starting at 24 h postinoculation, had 100% survival after 35 days, while controls (untreated) or animals that received 15 mg of ketoconazole or 100 mg of terbinafine per kg/day by the same route had 0% survival after the same period of time. However, all mice receiving the combination of 15 mg of ketoconazole plus 100 mg of terbinafine per kg/day survived for 35 days after infection; it was shown that the survival of the animals treated with this combination was statistically greater than that obtained with either drug acting alone and was indistinguishable from that observed with the high doses of ketoconazole, indicating a synergistic action of the drugs in vivo. However, most animals that survived after the 7-day treatments were not cured, as indicated by a delayed but persistent parasitemia. When the treatment was extended to 14 days, 100% survival was obtained 10 weeks after inoculation for mice treated with 30 mg of ketoconazole per kg/day and the combination of 15 mg of ketoconazole per kg/day plus 100 mg of terbinafine per kg/day, while two-thirds of the mice treated with 15 mg of ketoconazole per kg/day alone were alive after the 14-day treatment; controls or animals that received 100 mg of terbinafine per kg/day did not survive after 25 days. Parasitemia in all surviving mice was negative after 55 days but parasitological cure, as assessed by subinoculation of organs in naive animals, was predominant only in animals that received the combined drug treatment. We also investigated the bistriazole ICI 195,739 and found, as reported previously, that just 1 mg of the compound per kg/day administered orally for 5 days was enough to protect most mice from death 30 days after inoculation, but no parasitological cures were observed. However, in the protocol used in the present study, the protective activity of ICI 195,739 at suboptimal doses (0.5 mg/kg/day) could be enhanced when it was used in combination with terbinafine at doses of the allylamine that by themselves induced no significant protection. Survival of the mice was inversely correlated with the levels of parasitemia in all cases. Extension of the treatment period with the triazole to 15 days at 1 mg/kg/day afforded definitive protection against death, with parasitological cure being achieved in 50% of mice at 10 weeks postinoculation, but no enhancement of its activity at suboptimal doses was observed when it was used in combination with terbinafine during this extended observation period. Taken together, these results supports the proposition that ketoconazole used in combination with terbinafine could be useful in the treatment of humans with Chagas' disease because it can promote parasitological cure without the need to resort to the use of high levels of the azole, which is known to interfere with hepatic function and steroid synthesis in the host. They also support the conclusions of previous in vitro studies which suggested that the triazole ICI 195,739 blocks the proliferation of T. cruzi by a mechanism which differs from those of classical ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors."}
