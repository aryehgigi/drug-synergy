For patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation who experience resistance via ERBB2 amplification, no targeted drug has been demonstrated to be effective. ### Patient Concerns A 56-year-old female nonsmoker suffered from left leg paralysis and low back pain. Imaging examination revealed a mass in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe lung and possible multiple metastases in the right hilar, mediastinal lymph nodes, bone metastases, and soft tissue invasion. ### diagnosis Transbronchial lung biopsy revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (cT4N2M1c, stage IV). An EGFR exon 19 deletion was identified using amplification refractory mutation system. ### interventions After the patient was treated with gefitinib initiation (250\u200amg/d) for 15\u200amonths, the tumor progressed with ERBB2 amplification revealed by next-generation sequencing test. Then, the patient was started on afatinib (40\u200amg/d) plus bevacizumab (7.5\u200amg/kg every 3\u200aweeks). ### outcomes The combination therapy of afatinib and bevacizumab in this patient was effective with some slight side effects. Computed tomography scans showed the tumor shrinkage and the pleural effusion disappeared in the right lung. The overall survival was 23.5\u200amonths. ### conclusion To date, there is no targeted therapy approved and demonstrated to be effective for non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations, and ERBB2 amplification. The effectiveness of combination therapy with afatinib and bevacizumab may provide a new therapeutic option for these patients."}

Prior reports have suggested diminished responses to sequential lines of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies, but it is unknown whether subsequent taxane-based chemotherapy may be more effective than sequential AR-targeting treatment. We sought to evaluate the clinical activity of enzalutamide versus docetaxel in men with mCRPC who progressed on abiraterone. ### methods We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of consecutive mCRPC patients who had progressed on abiraterone therapy and subsequently received either enzalutamide (n=30) or docetaxel (n=31). We evaluated clinical outcomes including prostate-specific antigen decline of >30% (PSA30) or >50% (PSA50), PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and clinical/radiographic PFS. We performed multivariable modeling to control for baseline and on-treatment differences between groups. ### results Compared to subjects who received enzalutamide post-abiraterone, subjects who received docetaxel post-abiraterone had more bone metastases, more visceral metastases, higher baseline PSA, and had more frequent PSA tests while on-treatment. There were no significant differences in PSA30 (41% for enzalutamide vs. 53% for docetaxel) or PSA50 (34% vs. 40%) response rates between the two groups; there remained no difference after stratifying by presence/absence of prior response to abiraterone. Median PSA-PFS was 4.1 versus 4.1 months for the enzalutamide and docetaxel cohorts, respectively (HR 1.35, 95% CI, 0.53-3.66, P=0.502). Median PFS was 4.7 versus 4.4 months, respectively (HR 1.44, 95% CI, 0.77-2.71, P=0.257). PSA-PFS and PFS did not differ after stratifying by prior response to abiraterone. In multivariable analyses, there were no significant differences in PSA-PFS or PFS between the two groups. ### conclusions Treatment with either enzalutamide or docetaxel produced modest PSA responses and PFS intervals in this abiraterone-pretreated mCRPC population. In this retrospective study with small sample size, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between groups. Therefore, either enzalutamide or docetaxel may be a reasonable option in men who have progressed on abiraterone."}

The study will include 20 DSA-positive kidney allograft recipients diagnosed with ABMR \u2265\u2009365\u2009days after transplantation. Participants will be recruited at two study sites in Austria and Germany (Medical University of Vienna; Charit\u00e9 University Medicine Berlin). First, patients will enter a three-month double-blind RCT (1,1 randomization, stratification according to ABMR phenotype and study site) and will receive either clazakizumab (subcutaneous administration of 25\u2009mg in monthly intervals) or placebo. In a second open-label part of the trial (months 4-12), all patients will receive clazakizumab at 25\u2009mg every month. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clazakizumab, its effect on drug metabolism in the liver, DSA characteristics, morphological ABMR lesions and molecular gene expression patterns in three- and 12-month protocol biopsies, serum/urinary biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation/injury, Torque Teno viral load as a measure of overall immunosuppression, kidney function, urinary protein excretion, as well as transplant and patient survival. ### discussion Currently, there is no treatment proven to be effective in halting the progression of late ABMR. Based on the hypothesis that antagonizing the effects of IL-6 improves the outcome of DSA-positive late ABMR by counteracting DSA-triggered inflammation and B cell/plasma cell-driven alloimmunity, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide proof of concept of a novel treatment of this type of rejection. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03444103 .

Using static time-kill methodology, one C. albicans strain was exposed to 5 mg/L voriconazole for varying durations followed by 2.5 mg/L amphotericin B after three repeated washes of voriconazole. ### results Voriconazole and amphotericin B treatment alone resulted in fungistatic and fungicidal activities, respectively. Simultaneous administration of voriconazole and amphotericin B resulted in fungicidal activity, whereas only fungistatic activity was observed when repeated doses of amphotericin B were administered sequentially after voriconazole at 24-96 h. The inhibition of the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B was voriconazole dose-dependent, but seemed to be recovered once the voriconazole concentration fell below the MIC. The fungicidal activity was quickly regained after the removal of voriconazole, irrespective of the duration of voriconazole pre-exposure. ### conclusions Voriconazole inhibited the fungicidal effect of sequentially administered amphotericin B in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; the clinical significance of this needs further investigation."}

We aimed to clarify the effects of aspirin/cilostazol therapy on the platelet and endothelial functions of patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, in comparison to patients who were treated with aspirin alone. Methods The present randomized prospective pilot study enrolled 24 patients within a week after the onset of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (100 mg/day) (A group; 11 patients) or cilostazol (200 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) (CA group; 13 patients). We measured platelet aggregation, platelet activation, and the thrombomodulin (TM), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and von Willebrand (vWF) antigen levels and vWF activity over a 4-week period after enrollment. Results There was no significant difference in the platelet functions of the A and CA groups. However, the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was decreased at 2 and 4 weeks (p<0.05) after treatment in comparison to the pre-treatment values in the CA group, but not in the A group. Platelet activation, and the hs-CRP, TM, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and vWF values did not significantly decrease after treatment in either group. Conclusion Although there were no significant differences in platelet aggregation, platelet activation or the endothelial biomarker levels of the A and CA groups, dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol inhibited platelet aggregation in comparison to the pre-treatment values, similarly to patients who received aspirin alone. This may suggest the clinical usefulness of dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol in the treatment of patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke."}

All started a TDF + FTC combination between October 2005 and March 2010. Virological, biochemical, and clinical data were recorded during follow-up. Tolerance was also monitored. Patients were classified into either treatment simplification (TS), where efficacy of the previous treatment was obtained at TDF + FTC initiation, and treatment intensification (TI), where the previous line of therapy had failed. ### results TDF + FTC was given as a TI to 54 patients (69%) and as a TS to 24 (31%). Among patients with TI, 83% were males. The median baseline HBV-DNA was 4.4 log10 IU/mL, and median alanine-transaminase (ALT) was 1.10 \u00d7 ULN. Sixty percent were HBeAg positive, 47% had significant fibrosis (\u2265 F3 Metavir equivalent), and 29% had confirmed cirrhosis. Median treatment duration was 76 weeks (interquartile range 60-116). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that, 48 weeks after TI, the probability of being HBV-DNA becoming undetectable was 76%, and reached 94% at week 96. No viral breakthrough occurred. Patients with TS (87% males, median baseline HBV-DNA 1.1 log10 IU/mL, median ALT 0.79 \u00d7 ULN, 33% HBeAg positive, 61% with significant fibrosis) were treated for a median duration of 76 weeks. In this subgroup, all patients but one remained HBV-DNA undetectable and no ALT flare-up occurred during follow-up. Creatinine levels did not show kidney-function deterioration in either group of patients. ### conclusions After a median follow-up of > 76 weeks, the TDF + FTC combination showed encouraging antiviral efficacy and a good safety profile in all patients with CHB. TDF + FTC may represent an interesting clinical option to simplify therapy and increase the barrier to resistance, which should be assessed in the long term."}

Twenty-one genes were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the RS was calculated. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the value of adding RS to a model with clinical variables (age, tumor size, grade, and treatment) in node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) women. RESULTS Reportable scores were available from 1,231 evaluable patients (N0, n = 872; N+, n = 306; and node status unknown, n = 53); 72, 74, and six DRs occurred in N0, N+, and node status unknown patients, respectively. For both N0 and N+ patients, RS was significantly associated with time to DR in multivariate analyses (P < .001 for N0 and P = .002 for N+). RS also showed significant prognostic value beyond that provided by Adjuvant! Online (P < .001). Nine-year DR rates in low (RS < 18), intermediate (RS = 18 to 30), and high RS (RS > or = 31) groups were 4%, 12%, and 25%, respectively, in N0 patients and 17%, 28%, and 49%, respectively, in N+ patients. The prognostic value of RS was similar in anastrozole- and tamoxifen-treated patients. CONCLUSION This study confirmed the performance of RS in postmenopausal HR+ patients treated with tamoxifen in a large contemporary population and demonstrated that RS is an independent predictor of DR in N0 and N+ hormone receptor-positive patients treated with anastrozole, adding value to estimates with standard clinicopathologic features."}

TBF was associated with a trend towards higher risk of grades III-IV aGVHD (HR 1.8, P\u2009=\u2009.06) and inferior cGVHD (HR 0.7, P\u2009=\u2009.04) when compared with BuCy. In patients undergoing transplant in first remission, the advantage for TBF in terms of relapse was more evident (HR 0.4, P\u2009=\u2009.02), leading to a trend for better LFS in favor of TBF (HR 0.7, P\u2009=\u2009.10), while OS did not differ between the two cohorts. In conclusion, TBF represents a valid myeloablative conditioning regimen providing significantly lower relapse and similar survival when compared with BuCy. Patients in first remission appear to gain the most from this protocol, as in this subgroup a tendency for better LFS was observed when compared with BuCy."}

There is no consensus on which topical anesthetic is most effective in optimizing patient experience during the procedure. ### objective To determine whether there is a difference in the efficacy between atomized 2% tetracaine and 4% lidocaine as a topical anesthetic prior to transnasal endoscopy. ### Study Design Prospective, randomized, double-blind study. ### methods A total of 99 patients received oxymetazoline and were randomized to receive either 2% tetracaine or 4% lidocaine prior to transnasal endoscopy. Immediately following the procedure, participants completed a survey assessing level of discomfort and other adverse symptoms pertaining to the procedure using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). ### results There were no significant differences in VAS scores between the lidocaine and tetracaine groups. There were also no significant differences between genders in overall VAS scores and in the lidocaine and tetracaine subgroups. Older patients demonstrated significantly less discomfort or a sensation of bad taste overall. In contrast to patients receiving lidocaine, older patients receiving tetracaine experienced significantly less overall pain and discomfort, unpleasant taste, and dyspnea. ### conclusion In patients undergoing transnasal endoscopy, use of either 2% tetracaine or 4% lidocaine has similar effect. Tetracaine may be a better choice in older patients, however."}
