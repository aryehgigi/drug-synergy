The pertuzumab concentrations observed were consistent with simulations from a validated population PK model, indicating that trastuzumab and docetaxel did not alter pertuzumab PK. Comparison of geometric least-squares mean PK parameters between arms showed no impact of pertuzumab on the PK of trastuzumab or docetaxel. In conclusion, no PK DDI was observed when pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel were combined for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Cell cycle analysis revealed that imatinib\u2011treated AGS cells were arrested in the G2/M\u00a0phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, imatinib\u2011treated cells exhibited increased levels of phosphorylated JNK, and of the transcription factor\u00a0C/EBP homologous protein, an ER stress\u2011associated apoptotic molecule. Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5\u2011Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth, compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone. These data indicated that imatinib exerted cytotoxic effects on gastric cancer cells by inducing apoptosis mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and ER stress\u2011associated JNK activation. Furthermore, we revealed that imatinib induced the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting platelet\u2011derived growth factor receptor signaling. Collectively, our results strongly support the use of imatinib in the treatment of treating gastric cancer.", "d1": "imatinib", "d2": "irinotecan", "d1_first_index": "12", "d2_first_index": "16", "d1_last_index": "12", "d2_last_index": "16"}

Dysregulation of this pathway occurs in more than one-third of all malignancies, a process that has fostered the development of targeted Map kinase pathway inhibitors. Cutaneous melanomas, which arise from skin melanocytes, are the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Mutations that activate the Map kinase pathway occur in more than 90% of these melanomas. This has led to the development of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib and cobimetanib for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutant melanomas. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib target V600E/K BRAF mutants while trametinib and cobimetanib target MEK1/2. The latter two agents bind to MEK1/2 at a site that is adjacent to, but separate from, the ATP-binding site and are therefore classified as type III allosteric protein kinase inhibitors. These agents form a hydrogen bond with a conserved \u03b23-lysine and they make numerous hydrophobic contacts with residues within the \u03b1C-helix, the \u03b25 strand, and within the activation segment, regions of the protein kinase domain that exhibit greater diversity than those found within the ATP-binding site. One advantage of such allosteric inhibitors is that they do not have to compete with millimolar concentrations of cellular ATP, which most FDA-approved small molecule competitive inhibitors such as imatinib must do. Owing to the wide spread activation of this pathway in numerous neoplasms, trametinib and cobimetinib are being studied in combination with other targeted and cytotoxic drugs in a variety of clinical situations.

Cutaneous melanomas, which arise from skin melanocytes, are the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Mutations that activate the Map kinase pathway occur in more than 90% of these melanomas. This has led to the development of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib and cobimetanib for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutant melanomas. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib target V600E/K BRAF mutants while trametinib and cobimetanib target MEK1/2. The latter two agents bind to MEK1/2 at a site that is adjacent to, but separate from, the ATP-binding site and are therefore classified as type III allosteric protein kinase inhibitors. These agents form a hydrogen bond with a conserved \u03b23-lysine and they make numerous hydrophobic contacts with residues within the \u03b1C-helix, the \u03b25 strand, and within the activation segment, regions of the protein kinase domain that exhibit greater diversity than those found within the ATP-binding site. One advantage of such allosteric inhibitors is that they do not have to compete with millimolar concentrations of cellular ATP, which most FDA-approved small molecule competitive inhibitors such as imatinib must do. Owing to the wide spread activation of this pathway in numerous neoplasms, trametinib and cobimetinib are being studied in combination with other targeted and cytotoxic drugs in a variety of clinical situations. Except for BRAF and NRAS mutations, there are no other biomarkers correlated with treatment responses following MEK1/2 inhibition and the discovery of such biomarkers would represent an important therapeutic breakthrough.", "d1": "trametinib", "d2": "cobimetinib", "d1_first_index": "13", "d2_first_index": "15", "d1_last_index": "13", "d2_last_index": "15"}

Fewer patients (P = .001) discontinued the lenalidomide plus prednisone therapy (13%) because of side effects then patients on single-agents therapy (32%-39%).

The mainstay of treatment is drugs aimed at suppressing the immune system - corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. About 25% of patients are non-responders. Skeletal muscle cells seem actively involved in the immune-inflammatory response and not only a target; understanding the molecular bases of IMs might help drug development strategies. Within muscles the interaction between the chemokine interferon (IFN)\u03b3 inducible 10 kDa protein, CXCL10 or IP-10, and its specific receptor CXCR3, present on Th1 type infiltrating cells, likely plays a pivotal role, potentially offering the opportunity for therapeutic intervention. We aimed to clarify the involvement of human skeletal muscle cells in inflammatory processes in terms of CXCL10 secretion, to elucidate the engaged molecular mechanism(s) and, finally, to evaluate muscular cell responses, if any, to some immunosuppressants routinely used in IM treatment, such as methylprednisolone, methotrexate, cyclosporin A and Infliximab. We first isolated and characterized human fetal skeletal muscle cells (Hfsmc), which expressed the specific lineage markers and showed the competence to react in the context of an in vitro alloresponse.

The mainstay of treatment is drugs aimed at suppressing the immune system - corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. About 25% of patients are non-responders. Skeletal muscle cells seem actively involved in the immune-inflammatory response and not only a target; understanding the molecular bases of IMs might help drug development strategies. Within muscles the interaction between the chemokine interferon (IFN)\u03b3 inducible 10 kDa protein, CXCL10 or IP-10, and its specific receptor CXCR3, present on Th1 type infiltrating cells, likely plays a pivotal role, potentially offering the opportunity for therapeutic intervention. We aimed to clarify the involvement of human skeletal muscle cells in inflammatory processes in terms of CXCL10 secretion, to elucidate the engaged molecular mechanism(s) and, finally, to evaluate muscular cell responses, if any, to some immunosuppressants routinely used in IM treatment, such as methylprednisolone, methotrexate, cyclosporin A and Infliximab. We first isolated and characterized human fetal skeletal muscle cells (Hfsmc), which expressed the specific lineage markers and showed the competence to react in the context of an in vitro alloresponse.

However, resistance remains a major obstacle to improve efficacy. IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s signaling pathway is activated in many malignant tumors, and plays important roles in chemoresistance. Therefore, IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s might be a potential target to overcome the chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. In this study, we detected the activation of IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s signaling in patient cancer tissues and colorectal cancer cell lines. The phosphorylation level of IRE1\u03b1 and the spliced XBP1s were aberrantly elevated in colorectal cancer, and IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s signaling activation was correlated with high EGFR expression. By overexpression of EGFR protein or activation by EGF treatment, we found that EGFR activation could enhance the phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1 and spliced XBP1s expression. On the contrary, inhibition of EGFR decreased the IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s signaling. Further, we examined the downstream signaling pathways regulated by EGFR. Inhibition of ERK activity could reverse the EGFR induced IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s activation. Co-IP confirmed the physical interaction of ERK and IRE1\u03b1. Cell growth and colony formation assay showed that the inhibition of IRE1\u03b1 activity could suppress EGFR driven colorectal cancer cell proliferation.

Inhibition of EGFR signaling could enhance the efficacy of oxaliplatin in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity is aberrantly elevated in colorectal cancer, and EGFR signaling could activate IRE1\u03b1/XBP1s possibly through EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway.

Cetuximab could partially recover oxaliplatin-induced IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s activation, and therefore enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of oxaliplatin.

However, resistance remains a major obstacle to improve efficacy. IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s signaling pathway is activated in many malignant tumors, and plays important roles in chemoresistance. Therefore, IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s might be a potential target to overcome the chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. In this study, we detected the activation of IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s signaling in patient cancer tissues and colorectal cancer cell lines. The phosphorylation level of IRE1\u03b1 and the spliced XBP1s were aberrantly elevated in colorectal cancer, and IRE1\u03b1-XBP1s signaling activation was correlated with high EGFR expression. By overexpression of EGFR protein or activation by EGF treatment, we found that EGFR activation could enhance the phosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1 and spliced XBP1s expression.

It was not established as an authentic psychiatric entity until the diagnostic nomenclature of the American Psychiatric Association DSM III in 1980. In recent years, increasing attention among researchers has contributed to provide important information about the genetic, familial and temperamental bases of social phobia and its neurochemical, neuroendocrinological and neuroanatomical substrates, which remain to be further investigated. Up to date, there have been several findings about the possible influence of variables, including particularly genetic, socio-familial and early temperamental (eg behavioral inhibition) factors that represent risk for the later development of social phobia. Clinical neurobiological studies, based on the use of exogenous compounds such as lactate, CO2, caffeine, epinephrine, flumazenil or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin to reproduce naturally occurring phobic anxiety, have shown that patients with social phobia appear to exhibit an intermediate sensitivity between patients with panic disorder and control subjects. No difference in the rate of panic attacks in response to lactate, low concentrations of CO2 (5%), epinephrine or flumazenil was observed between patients with social phobia and normal healthy subjects, both being less reactive compared to patients with panic disorder. However, patients with social phobia had similar anxiety reactions to high concentrations of CO2 (35%), caffeine or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin than those seen in patients with panic disorder, both being more intensive than in controls. Several lines of evidence suggest specific neurotransmitter system alterations in social phobia, especially with regard to the serotoninergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Although no abnormality in platelet serotonin transporter density has been found, patients with social phobia appear to show an enhanced sensitivity of both post-synaptic 5HT1A and 5HT2 serotonin receptor subtypes, as reflected by increased anxiety and hormonal responses to serotoninergic probes. Platelet 5HT2 receptor density has also been reported to be positively correlated to symptom severity in patients with social phobia. During anticipation of public speaking, heart rate was elevated in patients with social phobia compared to controls. Norepinephrine response to the orthostatic challenge test or to the Valsalva maneuver was also greater in patients with social phobia. While normal beta-adrenergic receptor number was observed in lymphocytes, a blunted response of growth hormone to clonidine, an a2-adrenergic agonist, was reported. This suggests reduced post-synaptic a2-adrenergic receptor functioning related to norepinephrine overactivity in social phobia. Decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid have also been observed. There are relatively few reports of involvement of the adrenal and thyroid functions in social phobia, and all that has been noted is that patients with social phobia show an exaggerated adrenocortical response to a psychological stressor. Recent advances in neuro-imaging have contributed to find low striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding or low dopamine transporter site density in patients with social phobia. They have also demonstrated the involvement of the cortico-limbic pathways, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, which show an increased activity in different experimental conditions. These brain regions have extensively been reported to play an important role in the cognitive appraisal in determining the significance of environmental stimuli, in the emotional and mnemonic integration of information, and in the expression of contextual fear-conditioned behaviors, which might be disrupted in the light of the phenomelogical aspects of social phobia. A substantial body of literature based on case reports, open and placebo-controlled trials, has now clearly examined the efficacy of major classes of psychotropic agents including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines in social phobia. Until recently, irreversible non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, of which phenelzine was the most extensively evaluated, were considered as the most efficacious treatment in reducing the symptomatology associated with social phobia in 50-70% of cases after 4 to 6 weeks. However, side effects and dietary restrictions limit their use. This led to the development of reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, for which careful dietary monitoring is not required. Moclobemide has been the most widely studied but produced unconvincingly therapeutic effects on social phobic symptoms. To date, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be considered as a reasonable first-line pharmacotherapy for social phobia. There is growing evidence for the efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline. They have beneficial effects with response rates ranging from 50 to 80% in social phobia. It has been recommended that the treatment period should be extended at least 6 months beyond the early improvement achieved within the first 4 to 6 weeks. The overall advantages include tolerability with a low risk of adverse events. The benzodiazepines clonazepam and alprazolam have also been proposed for the treatment of social phobia. Symptomatic relief occurred in 40 to 80% of the cases with a relatively rapid onset of action within the first two weeks. Untoward effects, discontinuation-related withdrawal symptoms and abuse or dependence liability constitute major concerns about the use of benzodiazepines, so they should be reserved for cases unresponsive to the safer medications cited above. Beta-blockers such as atenolol and propanolol have commonly been employed in performance anxiety, decreasing autonomic symptoms (eg, tachycardia, sweating and dry mouth). However, they are not effective in the generalized form of social phobia. Other pharmacologic alternatives seem helpful for the management of social phobia, including venlafaxine, gabapentin, bupropion, nefazodone or augmentation with buspirone.

Based on data from two phase I studies, the docetaxel dose recommended for phase II study in combination with estramustine in minimally and extensively pretreated patients is 70 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2, respectively. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia. In one phase I study, 63% of the 34 patients treated showed at least a 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen. An objective response was seen in 28% of patients with measurable disease, and overall median survival (22.8 months) is highly encouraging. In the second study, 82% of 17 patients showed a greater than 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen and, at the 70 mg/m2 dose level, two of six patients showed prostate-specific antigen normalization. Phase II studies have demonstrated more than 50% declines in 59% to 88% of patients treated at 70 mg/m2. Although reduction of the dose of estramustine appears to result in a somewhat lower response rate, the contribution made by estramustine to the efficacy of the estramustine/docetaxel combination must be established by randomized trials. Dexamethasone, however, does not appear to significantly contribute to the response rate of estramustine and docetaxel.

The present authors investigated whether AMP induced a greater imbalance in the ventilation/perfusion ratio than methacholine (MCh), at an equivalent degree of bronchoconstriction, with and without salbutamol pre-medication. In total, 36 asthmatics were studied in three randomised, double-blind, crossover studies: 1) before and after AMP or MCh; 2) before and 30 min after salbutamol or placebo, followed by AMP; or 3) MCh challenge. Sputum was collected before and 4 h post-challenge. Compared with MCh, AMP provoked similar pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities at an equivalent degree of intense bronchoconstriction (forced expiratory volume in one second decrease of 28-44%). While salbutamol blocked AMP- or MCh-induced bronchoconstriction, arterial oxygen tension (P(a,O(2))) and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference (P(A-a,O(2))) disturbances induced by AMP and MCh were only partially blocked (P(a,O(2)) by 46 and 42%, respectively; P(A-a,O(2)) by 58 and 57%, respectively). Compared with MCh, AMP increased the percentage of neutrophils (mean+/-se increased from 28+/-4% to 38+/-4%), but this increase did not occur after salbutamol pre-treatment.
