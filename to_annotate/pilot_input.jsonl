Chemotherapy, which is one fundamental therapy mode for local disease control of inoperable disease or if organ preservation is desired, has become an important factor of first line treatment regimens either during or prior to radiotherapy (RT). Patients with locoregionally advanced inoperable, recurrent or metastatic disease still have a poor prognosis, which enforces the need for new treatment approaches and new drug therapies, adjusted to the different settings of the disease. One innovative progress for this collective of patients with locally advanced tumor was the implementation of Docetaxel in chemotherapeutic regimes in optimal combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy or in neoadjuvant setting of induction phase treatment. Docetaxel combined with the conventional chemotherapy regimen, containing Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (TPF), is now acknowledged as being the gold standard of induction treatment. Various studies suggest survival advantage due to the induction chemotherapy (ICT) followed by chemoradiotherapy, which is known as sequential therapy, over chemoradiotherapy alone. In contrast to prevailing studies we administered Docetaxel, Carboplatin and 5-FU within the frame-work of induction chemotherapy instead of conventional use of Cisplatin for five patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC. The clinical progress was evaluated through cross section imaging (computer tomography/MRI) prior and after ICT and classified following the RECIST criteria. Due to a very small collective of patient and the administration of Carboplatin instead of Cisplatin in this study, it was not possible to document the the efficacy of ICT (TPF) concerning survival advantage in patient with locoregionally advanced head and neck tumors. Further studies with an extended collective of patients are neccessary."}

Aberrant epigenetic modifications, including altered DNA methylation, seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of these patients. In fact, hypomethylating agents (HMA) like azacitidine have been successfully used in clinical trials and achieved approval from health authorities. There is now growing evidence suggesting that the combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action might offer a potential benefit to these patients. This is especially done with the intention to synergize the positive effects of each drug on the defective hematopoiesis while sparing potential side effects and toxicities. Combination of HMA with histone deacetylase inhibitors, although mechanistically very tempting, have not yielded convincing improvement of the results in the majority of trials compared to single agent HMA treatment.

The efficacy of torasemide in reducing salt and water retention in CHF has been established in double-blind comparative studies against furosemide. Torasemide has been shown to be at least as effective as furosemide in terms of total volume of urine excreted and also has a longer duration of action. The efficacy of torasemide (in terms of improved CHF symptoms and reduced pulmonary congestion, oedema and bodyweight) has been shown in randomised controlled trials and confirmed in large postmarketing studies. In addition, data from postmarketing studies have shown that patients receiving torasemide had significantly reduced hospital admission rates compared with patients receiving furosemide. Pharmacoeconomic assessments of torasemide have focused on its effect in reducing hospitalisation. Hospitalisation costs due to CHF decreased by 86% during the 11.2-month period of torasemide treatment, compared with the 6-month period prior to treatment, in a US retrospective study assessing medical and pharmacy claims data. Overall, average monthly costs for patients decreased by 56.6% after 5.1 months (from $US1,897.28 to $US823.70 per patient per month; PPPM), and by 76% after 11.2 months (from $US1,944.76 to $US470.76 PPPM) of torasemide treatment. In the furosemide group, average monthly costs for patients increased moderately from $US227.28 to $US261.18 PPPM after 12 months. Direct comparison of the torasemide and furosemide study groups was not possible because the group receiving torasemide had much higher healthcare resource use at baseline. Compared with furosemide, torasemide was associated with reduced rates of hospital admissions for CHF and/or cardiovascular causes in 3 studies, a retrospective analysis conducted in Germany, a prospective US study of patients enrolled from hospital admissions and a decision-analysis model. As a result, the direct costs of treatment for CHF or cardiovascular diseases for patients treated with torasemide were less than those with furosemide. However, in the US study, there was no statistically significant difference in hospital admissions for all causes and/or in overall direct medical costs, although the study was not powered to show this. In another US study of managed care patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III CHF, no difference in clinical or economic outcomes was observed between patients taking torasemide or furosemide; despite the higher acquisition costs for torasemide, total costs were similar for both groups. Torasemide was found to be more cost effective than furosemide in terms of cost per patient with improved functional (NYHA) class of CHF severity in a retrospective German analysis, although this measure is not ideal. This study also evaluated indirect costs (for loss of productivity of employed patients) and resultssuggest torasemide has a favourable effect in reducing days off work compared with furosemide, although the population of employed patients in the study was very small. Torasemide has been shown to improve some measures of quality of life in 2 studies. It was associated with higher quality-of-life scores than furosemide in a 6-month study, but the differences were only significant at month 4. In another study, torasemide significantly improved fatigue, but full study details are yet to be published."}

Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide completely suppressed the response to 8-Br-cAMP. When gene transcription was inhibited by actinomycin, vasopressin release was stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP for approximately 2 h, but the response was not sustained. Vasopressin mRNA content was not changed by 8-Br-cAMP in the absence or presence of cycloheximide, but it was significantly decreased by simultaneous exposure to 8-Br-cAMP and actinomycin. Actinomycin alone did not change vasopressin mRNA content. Since other studies have demonstrated that cAMP stimulates vasopressin gene transcription, and since vasopressin mRNA content reflects the balance between gene transcription and mRNA degradation, the effect of actinomycin and 8-Br-cAMP on vasopressin mRNA content suggests that 8-Br-cAMP also decreased vasopressin mRNA stability and thereby induced a rapid turnover of vasopressin mRNA. The effects of cycloheximide and actinomycin on vasopressin and oxytocin release suggest that ongoing protein synthesis is required for stimulation of hormone release. Since the posterior pituitary hormone stores are not depleted with a stimulus for release that is even more potent than cAMP, it is possible that cycloheximide and actinomycin depleted smaller pools of the peptides such as those responsible for intranuclear vasopressin and oxytocin release. Further evidence that intranuclear release of vasopressin and oxytocin is a prerequisite for cAMP stimulation of vasopressin and oxytocin release was obtained by demonstrating that d(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Me)VAVP, a potent combined V1a/V2/oxytocin receptor antagonist blocked stimulation of vasopressin and oxytocin release by 8-Br-cAMP."}

All drugs were injected intraperitoneally, diphenylhydantoin - 75 min and the benzodiazepines - 60 min before the test. Adding either clonazepam or chlordiazepoxide (in doses moderately increasing the convulsive threshold) was more effective than doubling the dose of diphenylhydantoin. Both the interaction between benzodiazepines and diphenylhydantoin at the level of the receptor for picrotoxin-barbiturates and benzodiazepine-induced potentiation of specific diphenylhydantoin binding are likely to contribute to the observed phenomenon. On the other hand, a diphenylhydantoin-induced increase in the total number of specific benzodiazepine binding sites seems of minor importance since clonazepam (with a high affinity for these sites) and chlordiazepoxide (with a low affinity) were equipotent in the enhancement of the combined treatment efficacy."}

For the last 30 years, the standard of care for this disease has consisted of combination chemotherapy with a platinum-containing regimen as first-line therapy. Cisplatin is the most active cytotoxic agent against bladder cancer, but because of competing comorbidities, many patients are ineligible for this agent and instead receive carboplatin. The two-drug regimen of cisplatin and gemcitabine was found to be better tolerated and have comparable efficacy as the four-drug regimen of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) in a randomized study of patients with advanced disease. Therefore, cisplatin (or carboplatin) and gemcitabine is the most commonly used first-line regimen in this setting. No agents have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for second-line therapy in ABC. If patients are eligible for additional systemic treatment at the time of progression, options include single-agent therapy such as a taxane or pemetrexed, though given the lack of standard approaches participation in a clinical trial should be strongly encouraged. Recent molecular characterization of ABC reveals significant genetic heterogeneity and actionable genomic alterations in the majority of tumors. Emerging therapies may effectively target known molecular drivers of ABC, including the FGFR2, EGFR/HER2, VEGF, MET, and PI3/AKT/mTOR pathways. Reports of dramatic and prolonged responses to targeted therapy provide additional support for the use of genome sequencing in the rationale selection of treatment for subsets of patients. The current focus of clinical trial development is to design molecularly driven studies that \"match\" tumors with driver mutations and appropriate targeted therapies rather than a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach based on clinical and pathologic parameters of disease. The hope of patients and clinicians alike is that this therapeutic approach combined with novel agents may usher in a new era of effective treatments for patients with ABC."}

The purpose of this study was to determine the dose of pentostatin (dCF) that could be combined with chlorambucil and prednisone to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), evaluate the toxicity of the resulting regimen and to estimate its efficacy. This was a multi-institutional Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) phase I-II study. Individuals with active B-CLL were eligible if they had no prior treatment or were in sensitive first relapse, provided they had normal renal and hepatic function. Pentostatin was evaluated in combination with orally administered chlorambucil 30 mg/m2 and prednisone 80 mg/day, 1-5 of each 14-day cycle. The pentostatin dose was 2 mg/m2 IV, day 1 for the first 6 patients; 3 mg/m2 IV, day 1 for the next 6 patients; and 4 mg/m2 IV, day 1 for the last set of 6 patients. Fifty-five patients were entered. Because of increasing toxicity with no apparent improvement in clinical efficacy on escalation of the pentostatin dose, 2 mg/m2 was chosen as the phase II dose, and 43 patients were treated at this level. Thirty-nine of these patients were eligible, of which 38 were evaluable for response, 36 of these 38 had no prior treatment. Complete response (CR) manifested by normal bone marrow morphology, peripheral blood counts and resolution of any lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly occurred in 17 patients (45%). The overall objective response rate was 87%. The median response duration was 33 months and the median survival 5 years. The median time to treatment failure is 32 months.

Overall, 11 patients had H. Zoster while on study. Due to toxicity, 33% of patients stopped therapy. Pentostatin, chlorambucil and prednisone is a highly active regimen in CLL but cannot be recommended in present form because of an unacceptable incidence of opportunistic infections. These findings add to other recent reports which suggest combination therapy with pentostatin and alkylators are active in B-CLL. However, these combination chemotherapies will need to be combined with appropriate addition of anti-bacterial and anti-viral prophylaxis to reduce infection risk for B-CLL patients."}

The latter response was only evident when the pulmonary vascular tone was increased with either alveolar hypoxia (0% O2) or KCl (20 mM). The pressor response to angiotensin II was also attenuated in the presence of Lx. The vasodilatory response in perfused lungs was attenuated by methylene blue (2 x 10(-5) M), a putative inhibitor of the soluble guanylate cyclase but not by pretreatment with meclofenamate (10(-5) M), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor.

The most used penicillin was amoxicillin, followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ampicillin (minimal use in Brazil). Before the restrictions, the seasonal variation in penicillin use was 1.1 DDD/TID in Mexico and 0.8 DDD/TID in Brazil. In Mexico, we estimated a significant decrease in the seasonal variation of 0.4 DDD/TID after the restriction, mainly due to changes in seasonal variation of amoxicillin and ampicillin. In Brazil, the seasonal variation did not change significantly, overall and in the breakdown by individual active substances. For Mexico, inappropriate penicillin use may have diminished after the restrictions were enforced. For Brazil, increasing use and no change in seasonal variation suggest that further efforts are needed to reduce inappropriate penicillin use. "}

Longer time course studies, in presence of fetal calf serum, revealed that cell growth was finally reduced by all 4 bisphosphonates (40% after 7 days). Type I collagen synthesis was transiently increased by all 4 bisphosphonates after only 48 h incubation (+17% to +67%, p<0.05). Clodronate increased ALP activity by up to 1.7-fold after 4 days of culture (p<0.05) whereas ibandronate or zoledronate exhibited lesser stimulatory effects (+17 to +30%), and pamidronate had no significant effect. In conclusion, we found that different bisphosphonates, currently used or tested in various clinical conditions, transiently stimulated the growth of preosteoblastic cells and thereafter increased their differentiation according to sequential events (type I collagen synthesis first, then ALP activity to a lesser extent). Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of bisphosphonate treatment on bone mass and integrity could be partly mediated through a direct action on osteoblasts."}

There are no reports, however, of bupropion functioning as a Pavlovian occasion setter (i.e. feature positive modulator). The present experiment seeks to fill this gap in the literature by training bupropion in rats as a feature positive modulator that disambiguates when a light will be paired with sucrose. Specifically, on bupropion (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal) sessions, offset of 15-second cue lights were followed by brief delivery of liquid sucrose; saline sessions were similar except no sucrose was available. Rats readily acquired the discrimination with more conditioned responding to the light on bupropion sessions. Bupropion is approved for use as a smoking cessation aid, and more recently has drawn attention as a potential pharmacotherapy for cocaine and methamphetamine abuse. Accordingly, after discrimination training, we tested the ability of cocaine (1-10 mg/kg), methamphetamine (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) and nicotine (0.00625 to 0.2 mg/kg) to substitute for the bupropion feature. Nicotine (0.05 mg/kg) and methamphetamine (0.3 mg/kg) substituted fully for bupropion; cocaine did not substitute. These results extend previous research on shared stimulus properties between bupropion and other stimulants to a Pavlovian occasion setting function. Further, this is the first report of nicotine and methamphetamine substitution for bupropion. The overlap in stimulus properties might explain the effectiveness of bupropion as a smoking cessation aid and highlight the possible utility of bupropion for treatment of stimulant use disorder."}

Combined twice daily salmeterolfluticasone propionate 50/100 and 50/250 microg produced greater improvements in lung function than inhaled budesonide at higher dosages than fluticasone propionate in the combination. Combined salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/250 microg produced similar improvements in lung function to concurrent budesonide 800 microg plus formoterol 12 microg when given twice daily for 12 weeks. In another 12-week trial, combined salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/100 microg was more effective than oral montelukast 10 mg/day plus fluticasone propionate 100 microg twice daily in patients with suboptimally controlled asthma. Salmeterol/fluticasone is more cost effective than monotherapy with fluticasone propionate or budesonide. The most frequent adverse events associated with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate are headache, throat irritation, hoarseness and candidiasis."}

Activity of the enzyme was measured by following the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E(2) and prostaglandin F2alpha. Although prostaglandin H synthase-1 activity was not altered by these concentrations of the prostaglandin H synthase-2 inhibitors, it was found that exposure to these agents prior to aspirin or indomethacin (irreversible prostaglandin H synthase inhibitors) significantly attenuated the inhibition obtained by the latter inhibitors. On the other hand, the same concentrations of the prostaglandin H synthase-2 inhibitors did not interfere with prostaglandin H synthase-1 inhibition that was induced by naproxen or ibuprofen (competitive prostaglandin H synthase inhibitors). Attenuation of the indomethacin inhibition of prostaglandin H synthase-1 by prostaglandin H synthase-2 inhibitors was observed only when the microsomes were pre-exposed to DuP-697 or NS-398 in the absence, but not in the presence, of arachidonic acid. The effect of DuP-697 was found to be irreversible, however, washing away the agent reversed the action of NS-398. Similar phenomena have been reported by us in bovine aortic endothelial cells and in human dermal fibroblasts. Attenuation of the inhibition by aspirin and indomethacin, without altering the enzyme's basal activity or the inhibition induced by ibuprofen or naproxen may suggest the possibility that the prostaglandin H synthase-2 specific inhibitors DuP-697 and NS-398 affect prostaglandin H synthase-1 by interaction with a site different from the enzyme's catalytic site."}

In vivo using GvHR, Thd and H-Thd alone proved as active as CsA. The association in vitro and in vivo of each compound with CsA at different low concentrations, produced an additive effect as strong as CsA used alone at high therapeutic concentrations. In summarizing, this study revealed that: (1) despite its weaker potency in vitro than that of CsA, H-Thd presents interesting immunosuppressive properties similar to, and in some cases, better than Thd, and (2) the combination of H-Thd or Thd with CsA at suboptimal concentrations leads to high activity."}

The purpose of the inflammatory reaction is the defense of the host for re-establishing the baseline homeostasis of the organism. Compared to the neuroendocrine changes associated to the stress response to injury, the inflammatory reaction is the major determinant of patient's recovery in the perioperative period. Perioperative inflammation is involved in the occurrence of various postoperative adverse outcomes other than only acute pain. By consequence, perioperative strategies which limit or control the inflammatory response might have beneficial effects on patient's recovery. The present review summarizes the current knowledges on the interactions between some of these strategies, specifically regional anesthesia (RA) techniques, and inflammation in the context of perioperative medicine. Regional anesthesia through its components i.e. local anesthetics and analgesic adjuvants like alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine) modulates the inflammatory response consecutive to tissue injury by various mechanisms, at different levels. While experimental studies have shown that RA techniques modulate both local and systemic inflammatory reactions, in contrast, clinical findings are inconsistent as actual RA techniques fail to impact major patients' outcomes beyond immediate postoperative analgesia. The discrepancy between experimental findings and clinical observations asks questions and argues for a different view of perioperative inflammatory processes, in other words for an individualized management of the patients. Future developments of tools to quantify inflammatory and immune profile of patients might certainly lead to exciting findings and to major improvements in perioperative medicine. "}

Acromegalic patients with unresectable tumors have a great benefit from somatostatin analog treatment. The growth hormone receptor antagonist pegvisomant is the newest modality for the treatment of acromegaly. The medical therapy of Cushing's disease is still based on the inhibition of steroid production. A new, promising somatostatin analog, pasireotide is evaluated in clinical trials. The rare TSH-producing tumor can respond to both dopamine agonist and somatostatin analog therapy. The application of conventional radiotherapy has decreased; radiotherapy is mainly used in the treatment of invasive, incurable or malignant tumors. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact role of radiosurgery and fractionated stereotaxic irradiation in the treatment of pituitary tumors."}

Using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), we have previously determined that a sunitinib dosage of 20 mg/kg per day increased kidney tumor perfusion and decreased vascular permeability in a preclinical murine RCC model. This sunitinib dosage causing regularization of tumor vessels was selected to improve delivery of gemcitabine to the tumor. DCE-MRI was used to monitor regularization of vasculature with sunitinib in kidney tumors to schedule gemcitabine. We established an effective and nontoxic schedule of sunitinib combined with gemcitabine consisting of pretreatment with sunitinib for 3 days followed by four treatments of gemcitabine at 20 mg/kg given 3 days apart while continuing daily sunitinib treatment. This treatment caused significant tumor growth inhibition resulting in small residual tumor nodules exhibiting giant tumor cells with degenerative changes, which were observed both in kidney tumors and in spontaneous lung metastases, suggesting a systemic antitumor response. The combined therapy caused a significant increase in mouse survival. DCE-MRI monitoring of vascular changes induced by sunitinib, gemcitabine, and both combined showed increased tumor perfusion and decreased vascular permeability in kidney tumors. These findings, confirmed histologically by thinning of tumor blood vessels, suggest that both sunitinib and gemcitabine exert antiangiogenic effects in addition to cytotoxic antitumor activity. These studies show that DCE-MRI can be used to select the dose and schedule of antiangiogenic drugs to schedule chemotherapy and improve its efficacy."}

Dopamine agonists are useful adjuvants to levodopa in the pharmacotherapy of parkinsonian patients. Monotherapy with dopamine agonists in early Parkinson's disease has been advocated in order to delay the occurrence of complications associated with long term administration of levodopa. The use of dopamine agonists alone provides an adequate antiparkinsonian effect in only a minority of patients. In early stages of Parkinson's disease, dopamine agonists can produce a clinical response comparable with levodopa but, thereafter, their efficacy wanes. Early initiation of combination therapy with levodopa and dopamine agonists appears to reduce the severity and delay the appearance of the complications associated with long term administration of levodopa. Currently, dopamine agonists are most commonly used in combination with levodopa in patients in advanced stages of the disease who experience fluctuations of their motor symptoms. Despite their different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles, the ergot derivatives bromocriptine, lisuride and pergolide appear to be very similar in terms of their clinical efficacy. Continuous dopaminergic stimulation by parenteral infusion of water-soluble dopamine agonists such as apomorphine and lisuride can overcome motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease. Other dopamine agonists such as cabergoline, pramipexole and ropinirole are currently being studied. Further studies with these compounds will be required to determine their efficacy and adverse effects in comparison with the currently available orally active ergot agonists. It has been suggested that oxidative stress resulting from dopamine metabolism may be reduced by the administration of dopamine agonists. These drugs may therefore slow the rate of progression of Parkinson's disease. At present, however, there is no convincing clinical data to support a neuroprotective effect of dopamine agonists."}

In the present study, we aimed to assess and rank the effectiveness and toxicity of all of the available chemotherapy regimens included in the last 15 years' randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas objectively. Methods PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Collaboration database, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for RCTs comparing chemotherapy regimens as first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Using a Bayesian network meta-analysis, we compared and ranked all included chemotherapy regimens in terms of the overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, and hematological toxicity. Results We identified 2,206 articles and included in the analysis 46 eligible articles reporting 44 RCTs with a total of 9,133 patients and 48 first-line intravenous systemic chemotherapy regimens. The models showed a good fit to the data. The top-ranked chemotherapy regimen for the overall survival was FP (simplified leucovorin + fluorouracil + nab-paclitaxel), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.45 versus gemcitabine monotherapy (95% credible interval 0.28-0.71).

There have been numerous reports of the in-vitro suppression of cytokine production by GCS based on quantitation of cytokines by ELISA on bulk supernatants from isolated cell culture systems. We report the use of a whole-blood intracellular cytokine assay which is more representative of an in-vivo environment. We examined the effects of GCS, prednisolone and dexamethasone, on cytokine production by individual cells (monocytes, T lymphocytes and natural killer or NK cells) in heterogenous cell populations. Cells in whole blood were activated with various stimuli: phorbol ester and calcium ionophore for T cells, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for monocytes, and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) plus interleukin (IL)-12 for NK cells. Brefeldin A was used as an intracellular transport inhibitor to enhance the detection of intracellular cytokine production. The effects of various concentrations (10-5, 10-7, 10-9 and 10-11 m) of GCS on cytokine production were studied using multiparameter flow cytometry. After surface staining with fluorescently-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to identify cell type, cells were fixed and permeabilised. Intracellular cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-10, IL-1alpha and beta, IL-2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-12 were stained with their respective conjugated MoAbs. The GCS both caused a dose-dependent modulation of cytokine production by T cells, monocytes and NK cells. After 4 h, a decrease in the MFI (amount of cytokine produced per cell) was noted for all cell types. After 24 h a decrease in both MFI and the percentage of cells producing cytokine was observed for all cell types. The exception was monocyte production of IL-10 which was enhanced at low concentrations of GCS (10-9 and 10-11 m). Our findings thus suggest that one anti-inflammatory mechanism of GCS action may be through inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha and beta, IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, and up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10."}

Among tumors carrying wild-type KRAS, mutations of BRAF or PIK3CA or loss of PTEN expression may be associated with resistance to the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment. On the other hand, EGFR ligands overexpression detected in tumor tissue is a promising positive predictive marker. There are also some initial observations that gene expression profiling could also contribute to clinical decision-making about the cetuximab and panitumumab treatments.

Apart from its antihypertensive property, reserpine also possesses transquillising and vasodepressor action, hence it is employed as supportive therapy in the treatment of cardiac disorders. Doxorubicin is a potent anticancer agent, the use of which is limited by its cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Epirubicin is a derivative of doxorubicin having more favourable therapeutic index than doxorubicin and possessing less hematologic and cardiac toxicity at comparable doses. The data presented in this paper show the effect of reserpine as a chemosensitizer, when used in combination with epirubicin on P388 murine leukemia cells sensitive (P388/S) and resistant to doxorubicin (P388/DOX) cells. Inhibition of 3H-TdR incorporation into DNA was used as an index of the cytotoxic effects of drug when used alone or in combination. The combination of reserpine (1 microM) and epirubicin (1.7, 8.6 and 17.2 microM) indicated a significant enhancement in the DNA biosynthesis inhibition in P388/S and P388/DOX cell lines. The most prominent feature of the multidrug-resistant cell is the reduced accumulation of the drug intracellularly. P388/DOX cells showed less accumulation of epirubicin in the cell as compared to that of the parental cell line. Further studies demonstrated that reserpine significantly enhanced the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin in both the cell lines. The nature of DNA damage caused by the combination of reserpine and epirubicin was irreversible when studied in P388/DOX cell line. The combination of reserpine (5mg/kg) and epirubicin (1mg/kg) significantly potentiated the antitumor activity of epirubicin in P388/DOX tumor bearing mice. These studies suggest that reserpine can be used as an adjuvant in the cancer chemotherapy to potentiate the antiproliferative activity of anticancer drugs."}

While response rates with newer combinations, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, are reportedly as high as 90%, response duration is generally short-lived. The most promising use of chemotherapy appears to be synchronous or adjuvant therapy with radiotherapy and/or surgery. Combined modality therapy of this type is able to improve the local control rates; 2 prospectively randomised studies from the United Kingdom each with several hundred patients have suggested a possible improvement in overall survival as well. The most active agents are methotrexate, cisplatin, bleomycin and fluorouracil. Further studies are urgently needed to assess the true role of and the indications for chemotherapy, and because of the world-wide importance of these tumours, the identification of even a modest improvement would have profound benefit. The use of chemotherapy outside studies should still be discouraged."}

The side effects of tocainide are similar to those of lidocaine, but possible interactions with lidocaine have not been examined thoroughly. With the increased use of these agents, emergency physicians must decide the safety of concurrent administration of lidocaine for local anesthesia or arrhythmia management. Twelve dogs were assigned randomly to either a lidocaine (L) or a tocainide/lidocaine (TL) group. The L group received lidocaine at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/min until the animals seized. The TL group received both loading and maintenance doses of tocainide to obtain therapeutic steady-state tocainide levels prior to receiving lidocaine at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/min. Venous blood samples to measure drug levels were obtained at 20-minute intervals and at the time of seizures. The average duration of lidocaine administration required to induce seizures in the L group was 70.0 +/- 7.5 minutes, and in the TL group 29.0 +/- 7.0 minutes (P less than .05). In addition, the average serum lidocaine level at the time of seizures was 11.2 +/- 1.0 micrograms/mL in the L group and 6.2 +/- 1.7 micrograms/mL in the TL group (P less than .05). Our results show that in animals the presence of a therapeutic serum level of tocainide lowers the seizure threshold following the administration of lidocaine. These findings may have important implications for clinical care because they suggest that lidocaine should be used cautiously and in reduced dosage in patients already taking tocainide."}

The combination of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) with concurrent chemotherapy has been proposed as one strategy to overcome acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the combined effects of gefitinib and pemetrexed on EGFR-TKI-sensitive and EGFR\u2011TKI\u2011resistant human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The antiproliferative effects of gefitinib and pemetrexed, alone and in combination, on the growth of NSCLC cell lines, were assessed using an MTT assay. The cytotoxic interaction between the two drugs was evaluated in\u00a0vitro using the combination index (CI) method. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry and alterations in signaling pathways were determined by western blot analysis. In the present study, it was identified that when cells were concurrently exposed to pemetrexed and gefitinib, cytotoxic synergism was present in the gefitinib-resistant PC9/GR human NSCLC cell line and antagonistic interactions were observed in the gefitinib-sensitive PC9 cell line. Synergism was associated with a combination of cell cycle effects of the different agents. In addition, the combination of pemetrexed and gefitinib decreased the levels of phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and B-cell lymphoma 2 as compared with those in the control. By contrast, antagonism was associated with gefitinib-induced G0/G1-phase blockade of gefitinib-sensitive cells, which interfered with the cell cycle-specific cytotoxicity of chemotherapy. The combination of pemetrexed and gefitinib generated synergistic effects in gefitinib-acquired resistant cells and antagonistic effects in gefitinib-sensitive cells, suggesting that EGFR-TKIs combined with pemetrexed may be a beneficial treatment strategy for NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.

The characteristic of these allergens is crucial to start prophylaxis and to make decision about specific immunotherapy. In asymptomatic period of the disease the most important factor is to prevent dryness of the skin using emollients, which reconstruct integrity and continuity of stratum corneum. This procedure prevents penetration of air-borne allergens across damaged skin barrier into the skin. In mild AD cases, pimecrolimus (mainly in children) and corticosteroids of the lowest potency alternatively with their basis should be recommended. In moderate intensity AD either topical treatment with calcineurin inhibitors i.e. tacrolimus and pimecrolimus or topical corticosteroids from 4-5 group of American classification should be applied. In addition, PUVA/UVB phototherapy may be beneficial, as well as immunotherapy with specific airborne allergen/s. Coexisting bacterial skin infections should be treated with systemic antibiotics (macrolides, quinolones, and cephalosporins), viral herpes infection systemically using acyclovir for 5-7 days, and fungal infections applying ketoconazole orally, accompanied by topical treatment with miconazole or other antimycotics. Severe AD is an indication for the systemic use of cyclosporin A (rather than corticosteroids), and antibiotics as mentioned above. Prolonged 3-5 year specific immunotherapy is significant concern for selected cases. Sensitive skin areas such as face, orbicular skin, flexures should be treated with pimecrolimus and tacrolimus rather than with corticosteroids, however, topical corticosteroids are recommended on involved skin of the trunk and the extremities besides of flexures. While the improvement of severe AD is reached, the treatment modalities for benign and mild AD should be observed. In all AD patients with active skin lesions antihistaminic drugs of 2nd generation reactive with H1 receptor are a gold standard (or short treatment with these drugs of 1st generation to achieve a sedative effect, followed by the 2nd generation drug), as well as tranquilizers as the combined treatment.

As such, robust clinical evidence supporting the use of these agents in patients with nccRCC is lacking. Here, we review the disparate nccRCC subtypes, the criteria for diagnosis, and the prognoses associated with each subtype, in addition to evaluating the potential use of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in treating patients with nccRCC. Both genetic analyses and preclinical research indicate a central role for mTOR in nccRCC; a therapy that targets this ubiquitous regulator of cellular signaling could prove efficacious across various tumor subtypes. Results from recent studies exploring targeted therapies as both monotherapy and combination therapy have provided early indications of efficacy in patients with nccRCC.

Ever since the early reports, it has been apparent that resistance to teicoplanin is more common than that to vancomycin and that resistance occurs mostly in species such as Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of teicoplanin for CNS usually fall over a wide range, and, especially in some methicillin-resistant isolates of the two above-mentioned species, they can reach and even exceed the resistance breakpoint, whereas vancomycin MICs tend to remain more stable over a narrower range within the limits of susceptibility. CNS strains intermediately susceptible and even resistant not only to teicoplanin but also to vancomycin have, however, been isolated, most frequently from patients subjected to prolonged glycopeptide treatment. Laboratory detection of glycopeptide-resistant CNS may be problematic, mainly because susceptibility tests, particularly those for teicoplanin, are influenced by various technical factors, and agar diffusion tests may yield false susceptibility data. In studies with experimental glycopeptides, some molecules have exhibited improved in vitro activity compared with teicoplanin and vancomycin, but these encouraging microbiological findings have not usually been followed by in vivo trials. Stepwise and single-step exposure to teicoplanin and vancomycin has allowed stable clones for which glycopeptide MICs are increased to be obtained from susceptible CNS strains, particularly strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In these studies, resistance to teicoplanin was generally easier to obtain than resistance to vancomycin, and the levels of teicoplanin resistance were higher. Population studies have demonstrated the usually heterogeneous nature of glycopeptide resistance in CNS. Although glycopeptide-resistant CNS have been shown to differ in several features from their glycopeptide-susceptible counterparts, the exact mechanism of staphylococcal glycopeptide resistance remains unknown."}

Antimicrobial treatment of diarrheic calves should therefore be focused against E coli in the small intestine and blood, the 2 sites of infection. Fecal bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not recommended in calves with diarrhea because fecal bacterial populations do not accurately reflect small intestinal or blood bacterial populations and because the break points for susceptibility test results have not been validated. Antimicrobial efficacy is therefore best evaluated by the clinical response of a number of calves to treatment, with calves randomly assigned to treatment groups. Amoxicillin, chlortetracycline, neomycin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamethazine, and tetracycline administered PO are currently labeled in the United States for the treatment of calf diarrhea. On the basis of published evidence for the oral administration of these antimicrobial agents, only amoxicillin can be recommended for the treatment of diarrhea. Dosage recommendations are amoxicillin trihydrate (10 mg/kg PO q12h) or amoxicillin trihydrate-clavulanate potassium (12.5 mg combined drug/kg PO q12h) for at least 3 days; the latter constitutes extra-label drug use. Parenteral administration of broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobials--ceftiofur (2.2 mg/kg IM or SC q12h) and amoxicillin or ampicillin (10 mg/kg IM q12h)--or potentiated sulfonamides (25 mg/kg IV or IM q24h) is recommended for treating calves with diarrhea and systemic illness; both constitute extra-label drug use. In calves with diarrhea and no systemic illness (normal appetite for milk, no fever), it is recommended that the health of the calf be monitored and that oral or parenteral antimicrobials not be administered."}

Though 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) can be administered via bolus or infusional schedules, the intermittent infusional schedule has been a mainstay of fluoropyrimidine-based regimens. This strategy, however, requires the insertion of central venous catheters and infusion pumps, which represent major inconveniences for patients and are associated with an increased risk for complications. Capecitabine is an orally administered fluoropyrimidine carbamate that is absorbed intact from the gastrointestinal tract and becomes metabolically activated to 5-FU within the tumor. Orally administered chemotherapy gives patients greater flexibility and independence and, as a result, may improve compliance and lower overall healthcare costs. Several randomized phase III studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of capecitabine in mCRC, whether used as monotherapy or in combination with oxaliplatin. However, dosing has been the subject of considerable debate, and there is evidence that dosing differs among clinical practices in Europe, Asia, and North America. The optimal dose and dosing schedule of capecitabine might require individualization based on specific patient factors, such as presence of comorbid illnesses, renal function, use of other prescription and nonprescription drugs, herbal and/ or nutritional supplements, and the development of adverse events. Guidelines for capecitabine dose modification/ interruption have been developed, and they should be used when trying to optimize oral fluoropyrimidine therapy for patients with mCRC."}

Coinfusion of lidocaine (LID) or diphenhydramine (DPH) at the steady state of DZ resulted in a sharp increase in the perfusate concentration of DZ, which was followed by a decline to a new steady-state concentration (Cnss) that was higher than the original Cnss value (46 and 45%, respectively). The initial sharp increase in DZ concentration was attributed to the displacement of DZ from its tissue binding sites; the higher Css values were due to the inhibition of N-oxidation and O-demethylation, and some unknown primary metabolic pathways. The kinetics of LID were altered by DZ; the steady-state extraction ratio of LID was reduced and the characteristic maximum in the concentration-time profile of its N-deethylated metabolite, MEGX, was abolished. These results suggest that DZ and LID share common isozymes in their disposition and that the two drugs are also capable of inactivating similar enzymes. The effect of enzyme inactivation on DZ disposition was evaluated by intraperitoneal pretreatment of rats with either saline (0.4 ml) or 1 of the 4 drugs--DZ (20 mg/kg), LID (30 mg/kg), DPH (20 mg/kg), and verapamil (10 mg/kg)--daily for at least 3 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"}

Dacomitinib is an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor with structural specificity for the catalytic domains of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2 and HER4 that has exhibited vigorous efficacy against other solid tumors. We evaluated the antitumor activity of dacomitinib in human bladder cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of HER family receptors. These cell lines also were established as bladder cancer xenografts in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice to assess dacomitinib activity in vivo. Significant cytotoxic and cytostatic effects were noted in cells expressing elevated levels of the dacomitinib target receptors with apoptosis and cell cycle arrest being the predominant mechanisms of antitumor activity. Cells expressing lower levels of HER receptors were much less sensitive to dacomitinib. Interestingly, dacomitinib was more active than either trastuzumab or cetuximab in vitro, and exhibited increased growth inhibition of bladder tumor xenografts compared with lapatinib. Pharmacodynamic effects of dacomitinib included decreased E-cadherin (E-cad) expression, reduction of EGFR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and reduced mitotic count. Dacomitinib also inhibited tumor growth in a chemotherapy-resistant xenograft and, when combined with chemotherapy in a sensitive xenograft, exhibited superior antitumor effects compared with individual treatments. Evaluation in xenograft-bearing mice revealed that this combination was broadly feasible and well tolerated. In conclusion, dacomitinib exhibited pronounced activity both as a single agent and when combined with chemotherapy in human bladder cancer models.

Drugs were infused for a 48 hours period in continuous infusion. The dosages were the same than in the intravenous regimens. Twenty patients with pelvic recurrences were included in this retrospective study: six were uterine cancers, fourteen were colo rectal cancers and two had advanced stage uterine cancer. Pain decreased in 10/14 patients with ano-rectal cancer pre sacral recurrence. Partial response was observed in 12 patients. Complete secondary surgical resection was possible in 4/14 rectal cancers and 6/6 uterine cancer recurrences. Chemotherapy induced a pathological complete response in 4/6 uterine cervix carcinoma recurrences. These observations led to perform pelvic intra arterial chemotherapy as first line treatment of locally-advanced inoperable pelvic tumors: 11 uterine cancers and five ano-rectal cancers. The objective were: tumor reduction before radiotherapy or surgery, tumor sterilization, decrease tumor volume for better radiation dosimetry, increase the chance of organ-preservation. The observation of tumor reduction in this small number of patients does not allow to draw definite conclusions. However the introduction of intra arterial pelvic chemotherapy as first line treatment of inoperable pelvic cancer warrants further studies."}

We tested the antitumor effects of HER-2 and VEGF peptide mimics in combination with metronomic paclitaxel in both PyMT and Balb/c murine model challenged with TUBO cells. The combination of low-dose paclitaxel and HER-2 or VEGF peptide mimics had greater inhibitory effects than either agent alone. Peptide treatment caused virtually no cardiotoxic effects, while paclitaxel and the anti-HER-2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), exerted consistent cardiotoxicity. The combination regimen also promoted significant reductions in tumor burden and prolonged survival rates in both transgenic and transplantable tumor models. Tumor weights were significantly reduced in mice treated with HER-2 peptides alone, and even more in animals that received HER-2 peptide with low-dose paclitaxel, which alone had no significant effects on tumor growth in the transgenic model. Specifically engineered native peptide sequences from HER-2 and VEGF used in combination with metronomic paclitaxel demonstrate enhanced anticancer efficacy and an encouraging safety profile. This novel approach to targeted therapy may offer new avenues for the treatment of breast cancer and other solid tumors that overexpress HER-2 and VEGF."}

Although studies focus mainly on the contribution of BCL-2, here we also investigate the contribution of other anti-apoptotic proteins to CHOP-therapy resistance in DLBCL. Functional dynamic BCL-2 homology (BH)3 profiling was applied to DLBCL cell lines upon CHOP treatment or single CHOP compounds. Cell-specific anti-apoptotic dependencies were validated with corresponding BH3-mimetics. We found high expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-XL in DLBCL cell lines and patients. CHOP treatment resulted in both enhanced and altered anti-apoptotic dependency. Enhanced sensitivity to different BH3-mimetics after CHOP treatment was confirmed in specific cell lines, indicating heterogeneity of CHOP-induced resistance in DLBCL. Analysis of single CHOP compounds demonstrated that similar changes could also be induced by doxorubicin or vincristine, providing evidence for clinical combination therapies of doxorubicin or vincristine with BH3-mimetics in DLBCL. In conclusion, we show for the first time that CHOP treatment induces increased anti-apoptotic dependency on MCL-1 and BCL-XL, and not just BCL-2. These results provide new perspectives for the treatment of CHOP-resistant DLBCL and underline the potential of BH3 profiling in predicting therapy outcomes."}

However, approximately half of those patients either do not respond to these therapies or develop secondary resistance. Although a few signaling pathways have been implicated, a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying HER2 inhibitor drug resistance is still lacking. To address this critical question, we undertook a concerted approach using patient expression data sets, HER2-positive cell lines, and tumor samples biopsied both before and after trastuzumab treatment. Together, these methods revealed that high expression and activation of a specific subset of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) was strongly associated with poor clinical prognosis and the development of resistance. Mechanistically, these RTKs are capable of maintaining downstream signal transduction to promote tumor growth via the suppression of cellular senescence. Consequently, these findings provide the rationale for the design of therapeutic strategies for overcoming drug resistance in breast cancer via combinational inhibition of the limited number of targets from this specific subset of RTKs."}

Incubation of hepatocytes from Wistar rats with leptin for 16 h caused a dose-dependent increase in incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen, with a maximal effect at 30 nmol/l leptin. This effect of leptin was observed over a range of glucose concentrations (10-25 mmol/l) and was associated with stimulation of net glycogen deposition. It was not counteracted by mercaptopicolinate, an inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, indicating that it is not due to increased gluconeogenic flux. Leptin also enhanced the short-term stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin. These effects of leptin were associated with inhibition of phosphorylase a, which occurred after 4 h of exposure to leptin. Culture with leptin for 16 h did not affect the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase or glucokinase or the activation state of glycogen synthase. Leptin did not affect glycolysis determined from the detritiation of [3-(3)H]glucose. The inhibitory effects of leptin on phosphorylase a were counteracted by short-term incubation with glucagon but were additive with the inhibitory effects of insulin and also with the inhibition caused by resorcinol (25 pmol/l), which inhibits phosphorylase kinase by a mechanism analogous to the antidiabetic drug proglycosyn. These results show that leptin has additive effects with insulin in inhibiting phosphorylase and stimulating glycogen storage in hepatocytes, indicating that these hormones act by separate but convergent mechanisms. It is concluded that the primary action of leptin in hepatocytes is to enhance glycogen storage. This may be an important compensatory mechanism for the inhibition of insulin secretion."}

In Experiment 2, bradykinin was administered daily at 100, 200, and 400 micrograms/kg doses SC either alone or in combination with captopril 10 mg/kg IP. Neither bradykinin nor captopril by themselves changed alcohol or water intake. Bradykinin combined with captopril stimulated water intake and reduced alcohol intake by up to 70%. This effect was not due to drug-induced changes in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist [Sar1,Thr8]-angiotensin II at 250 and 500 micrograms/kg SC attenuated the stimulation of water intake but not the reduction in alcohol intake. It is suggested that by inhibiting kininase II, ACE inhibitors extend the duration of action of bradykinin and thereby unmask a potent inhibition of alcohol intake mediated by kinins--an effect that is dissociable from the accompanying stimulation of water intake. Taken together, these results point to an involvement of the kinin system in the regulation of alcohol intake and in particular to a role of bradykinin in the suppressive effect of ACE inhibitors on alcohol intake."}

Platelets play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis, believed to be integrally involved in both the development and progression of atherosclerotic heart disease, as well as in its acute thrombotic complications. Antiplatelet therapy constitutes the cornerstone in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes and generally high-risk patients with atherothrombosis. Until recently, long-term antiplatelet therapy for the treatment and prevention of the complications of atherothrombotic disease was traditionally limited to aspirin. The availability of the thienopyridines, in particular clopidogrel, represents an important addition to the physician's armamentarium. Clopidogrel is currently one of the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease. Aspirin and clopidogrel interfere with platelet activation in complementary, but separate pathways. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase, thus preventing the production of thromboxane A(2), which is a prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive substance. Clopidogrel, a newer thienopyridine which has largely supplanted ticlopidine due to a more favorable safety profile, irreversibly prevents platelet activation by blocking one of the three known adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) receptors (the P2Y(12) receptor) on the platelet surface, thus interfering with platelet activation, degranulation and aggregation. Both these antiplatelet agents have a potent protective effect against adverse vascular events, but the combination of these two agents has an even stronger antiplatelet effect translating into superior antithrombotic protection in coronary, cerebral or peripheral arterial disease, without an inordinate increase in bleeding complications. A number of seminal clinical trials have demonstrated and confirmed the incremental benefit and efficacy of the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin therapy above and beyond that of aspirin alone, with multiple other important large-scale clinical trials currently ongoing. Newer data are being accumulated from studies where indications for the use of clopidogrel and aspirin continue to expand into other patient groups, rendering this dual antiplatelet drug therapy a sweeping combination in Cardiology. However, important issues remain to be further and more thoroughly explored about the benefit of this antiplatelet drug combination in these other patient groups, such as in patients with heart failure, where preliminary data indicate a favorable effect on thrombotic vascular events, in patients with atrial fibrillation, where there is hope that this combination may replace or be an alternative treatment modality to coumadin in certain subpopulations, in patients undergoing demanding catheter ablation procedures, where data point to a protective effect from thromboembolic events. Another pertaining issue to be further investigated is the occurrence of drug-resistance observed in some patients for both these antithrombotic agents. This article is a comprehensive review of all these data and the landmark trials on the two antiplatelet agents, the issues involved and the current recommendations for their use in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders and procedures."}

After one week of oral terbutaline, the mean EC50 (ng/L) of terbutaline increased for the eosinopenia from 1.87 +/- 1.66 to 3.78 +/- 2.18 (+102%) (p = 0.012) with placebo, and to 2.73 +/- 1.99 (+46%) (p = 0.025) with theophylline; for the hypokalemia the EC50 increased from 4.70 +/- 2.91 to 8.52 +/- 7.26 (+81%) (p = 0.012) with placebo, and to 5.64 + 2.59 (+20%) (p = 0.16) with theophylline. The results indicate that the non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline can prevent terbutaline-induced adrenergic down-regulation to a substantial degree."}

Here, we show that rapamycin treatment stimulated androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, whereas suppression of AR activity with the antiandrogen bicalutamide sensitized androgen-dependent, as well as AR-sensitive androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, to growth inhibition by rapamycin. Further, the combination of rapamycin and bicalutamide, but not the individual drugs, induced significant levels of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The net effect of rapamycin is determined by its individual effects on the mTOR complexes mTORC1 (mTOR/raptor/GbetaL) and mTORC2 (mTOR/rictor/sin1/GbetaL). Inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 by rapamycin-induced apoptosis, whereas rapamycin-stimulation of AR transcriptional activity resulted from the inhibition of mTORC1, but not mTORC2. The effect of rapamycin on AR transcriptional activity was mediated by the phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which also partially mediated apoptosis induced by rapamycin and bicalutamide. These results indicate the presence of two parallel cell-survival pathways in prostate cancer cells: a strong Akt-independent, but rapamycin-sensitive pathway downstream of mTORC1, and an AR-dependent pathway downstream of mTORC2 and Akt, that is stimulated by mTORC1 inhibition. Thus, the combination of rapamycin and bicalutamide induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by simultaneously inhibiting both pathways and hence would be of therapeutic value in prostate cancer treatment."}

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of combination of sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir \u00b1 ribavirin as a retreatment option for experienced Egyptian patients who failed previous sofosbuvir, daclatasvir \u00b1 ribavirin therapy. A total of 75 treatment-experienced patients were allocated for the completion of their treatment period according to criteria formed by the national committee for control of viral hepatitis. The enrolled patients were followed up throughout treatment, at the end of treatment and 3 months after the end of the treatment by clinical evaluation and laboratory investigations. 27 patients were treated with sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks while 48 patients were treated with sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir without ribavirin for 24 weeks. The per-protocol sustained virological response at week 12 (SVR12) rate was 100% in both groups while the intention-to-treat SVR12 was 93.4% in all patients, 97.9% in the 24 weeks group and 85.2% in the 12 weeks group. The regimen was well tolerated and the most common adverse effects observed across treatment and during follow-up period included fatigue (38.6%) and headache (29.3%), withdrawal due to adverse effects occurred in 6.6%. We can conclude that retreatment with sofosbuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir \u00b1 ribavirin is well tolerated and achieved high SVR12 rates in chronic HCV Egyptian patients with previous sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir treatment failure. Ribavirin free regimen for 24 weeks exerted significant lesser adverse effects."}
