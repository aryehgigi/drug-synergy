Blood was sampled immediately prior to premedication (temazepam), after induction of anaesthesia (fentanyl and thiopentone) and at 10-minute intervals until the end of the procedure (N2O maintenance, vecuronium relaxation).

Within 10 minutes of the first incision, however, there was a marked concordant rise in mean plasma ACTH and AVP levels for both procedures (conventional: ACTH, from a premedication value of 10.2 +/- 1.7 to 80.1 +/- 14.3 pmol/l, AVP from 1.2 +/- 0.4 to 117 +/- 24 pmol/l, P < 0.01 for both hormones; laparoscopic: ACTH from 5.8 +/- 2.6 to 55.1 +/- 26.0 pmol/l, AVP from 1.6 +/- 0.11 to 49.2 +/- 27.09 pmol/l). At the end of both types of operation mean levels of ACTH and AVP were still elevated, although the ACTH: AVP ratio had increased. Greater variability in ACTH and AVP responses was seen in the laparoscopic than in the conventional procedure, three patients showing a relatively small response to surgery. Total secretion of ACTH during both types of surgery was not significantly less both during (P < 0.05), and after (P < 0.01) laparoscopic surgery. For both procedures, the timing of AVP and ACTH peaks was significantly related (P < 0.002). A small but significant rise in CRH was observed 30 minutes after the start of surgery for both procedures P < 0.05). The timing of CRH and ACTH peaks was unrelated. The maximum mean plasma cortisol level for the conventional procedure (1268 +/- 147 nmol/l) was reached 20 minutes after reversal of anaesthesia and remained at this level until the end of sampling. The cortisol response was comparable during the laparoscopic procedure but was beginning to fall at 60 minutes post-operatively. Plasma adrenaline responses to the two types of surgery were not significantly different, but the plasma total noradrenaline response to laparoscopic surgery as indicated by the response area during the first 20 minutes was significantly increased (P < 0.02). Plasma sodium, renin activity and initial systolic blood pressure fall were not significantly different during the two procedures. ### conclusions For both procedures, the peak of ACTH secretion after incision is likely to be AVP dependent, and the timing of peak levels of these two hormones was significantly related. Subsequent ACTH secretion may be the result of an interaction between AVP and CRH. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in a smaller AVP rise than does the conventional procedure, and plasma AVP falls more rapidly post-operatively. During the period of observation, ACTH, CRH, cortisol and adrenaline responses were not significantly lessened by the laparoscopic approach, but there was a significant increase in the noradrenaline response. Stress hormone monitoring may assist further improvements in surgical technique."}

At visit 1, eligible subjects underwent conjunctival allergen challenge to identify the dose required to elicit a positive allergic reaction. After 7 days, subjects returned for visit 2, at which the allergen dose was confirmed. At visit 3, which took place 2 weeks later, subjects were randomized to receive either emedastine plus placebo capsules, loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, or both emedastine and loratadine. One hour after receiving study drug, subjects were challenged with allergen in both eyes. Allergic signs and symptoms were graded using standardized 5-point scales. The primary efficacy variables were itching and conjunctival hyperemia. Secondary efficacy variables were ciliary and episcleral hyperemia, chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing. Itching was graded subjectively at 3, 5, and 10 minutes after challenge. All other variables were assessed at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after challenge. ### results Eighty subjects (mean age, 43.68 years) were randomized to receive study treatment. Forty subjects (20 men, 20 women) received emedastine plus placebo capsules, 20 (7 men, 13 women) received loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, and 20 (12 men, 8 women) received both active treatments. In the between-group efficacy comparison at visit 3, the difference in itching and hyperemia scores between emedastine and loratadine was statistically significant at all time points (all, P < 0.05). Efficacy scores for the combination of emedastine and loratadine were significantly better than those for loratadine alone at 2 of 3 time points for itching and all time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05). The combination was significantly better than emedastine alone at I of 3 time points for itching and 6 of 9 time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05). ### conclusion In this study, emedastine was more efficacious than loratadine for reducing the itching and redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model."}

Achieving CR before consolidation was significantly associated with better survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 75% (95% CI 46.8-91.1%) for patients in CR before HDC, 33% (95% CI 9.7-70%) for patients in partial remission, and 0% for nonresponders (P\u00a0=\u00a0.033).", "abstract": "In order to describe relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mature acute leukemia in children/adolescents treated with the Lymphomes Malins B (LMB) regimen and their outcome in the rituximab era, relapses in the French LMB2001 study were reviewed. ### methods Between February 2001 and December 2011, 33 patients out of 773 (4.3%) relapsed; 27 had Burkitt lymphoma and six large B-cell histology. Median age at diagnosis was 10.1 years. One patient was initially treated in risk group A, 21 in group B, and 11 in group C. ### results Median time to relapse after diagnosis was 4.5 months (range 2.4-13.6). Thirty-two patients received salvage therapy. Twenty-seven received rituximab mainly in addition to high-dose cytarabine and etoposide (n\u00a0=\u00a018) and/or ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (n\u00a0=\u00a07). First-line salvage chemotherapy response rate was 66% with 47% being complete remission (CR). Twenty-one patients received high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous (n\u00a0=\u00a013) or allogeneic (n\u00a0=\u00a08) transplant. With a median follow-up of 6.8 years, the 5-year survival rate after relapse was 36.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22-53%). Twelve patients were still alive; all but one (group A) received consolidation treatment.

Response rates to salvage chemo-immunotherapies are insufficient and new drugs are urgently needed to improve disease control."}
