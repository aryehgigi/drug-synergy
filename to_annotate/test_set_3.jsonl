After 8 weeks, 71.4% versus 53.8% of patients achieved the BP goal (<140/90 mm Hg) with T/A versus A, with mean SBPs of 131.9 and 137.9 mm Hg, respectively. Similar results were observed in the obese (metabolic syndrome) subpopulation. The more stringent goal (<130/80 mm Hg) was achieved by 36.4% and 17.9% patients in the T/A and A groups, respectively. The most common adverse events were peripheral edema, headache, and dizziness. ### conclusions In this selected population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, T/A provided prompt and greater BP decreases compared with A monotherapy, with the majority of patients achieving the BP goal (<140/90 mm Hg)."}

The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (<or=3 years) who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. Etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage.

Infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate. All three agents, either alone (where so licensed) or in combination with ongoing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were effective in reducing the symptoms and signs of RA in patients with established disease. At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. Infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections. All ten published economic evaluations met standard criteria for quality, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from being within established thresholds to being very high because of varying assumptions and parameters. All three sponsors who submitted economic models made assumptions favourable to their product. BRAM incorporates improvements in quality of life and mortality, but assumes no effect of TNF inhibitors on joint replacement. For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and pound50,000 per QALY in late RA.

Meta-analyses of effectiveness data were also undertaken for each agent. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), a simulation model, was further developed and used to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. ### results Twenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of high quality, were included. The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (<or=3 years) who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. Etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage. Etanercept was also marginally more effective and better tolerated than methotrexate in patients with longer disease durations who had not failed methotrexate treatment. Infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate. All three agents, either alone (where so licensed) or in combination with ongoing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were effective in reducing the symptoms and signs of RA in patients with established disease. At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. Infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections. All ten published economic evaluations met standard criteria for quality, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from being within established thresholds to being very high because of varying assumptions and parameters. All three sponsors who submitted economic models made assumptions favourable to their product. BRAM incorporates improvements in quality of life and mortality, but assumes no effect of TNF inhibitors on joint replacement. For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and pound50,000 per QALY in late RA. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to the estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on TNF inhibitors and the effectiveness of DMARDs, but not to changes in mortality ratios per unit HAQ. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used last. The ICER for etanercept used last is pound24,000 per QALY, substantially lower than for adalimumab ( pound30,000 per QALY) or infliximab ( pound38,000 per QALY). First line use as monotherapy generates ICERs around pound50,000 per QALY for adalimumab and etanercept. Using the combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor as first line treatment generates much higher ICERs, as it precludes subsequent use of methotrexate, which is cheap. The ICERs for sequential use are of the same order as using the TNF inhibitor alone. ### conclusions Adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints. The combination of a TNF inhibitor with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone in early RA, although the clinical relevance of this additional benefit is yet to be established, particularly in view of the well-established effectiveness of MTX alone. An increased risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out for the combination of methotrexate with adalimumab or infliximab. The results of the economic evaluation based on BRAM are consistent with the observations from the review of clinical effectiveness, including the ranking of treatments. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used as last active therapy. In this analysis, other things being equal, etanercept may be the TNF inhibitor of choice, although this may also depend on patient preference as to route of administration. The next most cost-effective use of TNF inhibitors is third line, as recommended in the 2002 NICE guidance. Direct comparative RCTs of TNF inhibitors against each other and against other DMARDs, and sequential use in patients who have failed a previous TNF inhibitor, are needed. Longer term studies of the quality of life in patients with RA and the impact of DMARDs on this are needed, as are longer studies that directly assess effects on joint replacement, other morbidity and mortality."}

Adverse events were reported by 9% of patients in the isepamicin group (16/178) and 10% of patients in the amikacin group (9/89). Events considered to be related to treatment occurred in 6% of patients in both groups. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Renal problems caused three patients (2 isepamicin, 1 amikacin) to withdraw from the study. Ototoxicity (detected by audiometric testing) occurred in one patient (treated with isepamicin). In conclusion, isepamicin at a dose of 15 mg/kg once daily was shown to be as effective as amikacin (7.5 mg/kg twice daily) in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections in hospitalised adults also treated with metronidazole.

Model robustness was addressed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. ### results The total mean cost per-patient of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib was $292,308 and $169,287, respectfully. Nivolumab and ipilimumab generated a gain of 0.978 QALYs over sunitinib. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for nivolumab and ipilimumab was $125,739/QALY versus sunitinib. ### conclusion Our analysis established that the base case ICER in the model for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib is below what some would consider the upper limit of the theoretical willingness-to-pay threshold in the U.S. ($150,000/QALY) and is thus estimated to be cost-effective. ### Implications For Practice This article assessed the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib for treatment of patients with intermediate- to poor-risk metastatic kidney cancer, from the U.S. payer perspective. It would cost $125,739 to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib in these patients."}

Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. ### methodology We used a custom-designed Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro assay. ### Principal Findings We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP1A2 gene product, was chosen and tested. Sublethal doses of PZQ combined with OMP significantly increased worm mortality in vitro when compared with PZQ or OMP alone, thus evidencing a synergistic effect. ### conclusions Functional analysis of gene interaction networks is an important approach that can point to possible novel synergistic drug candidates. We demonstrated the potential of this strategy by showing that PZQ in combination with OMP displayed increased efficiency against S. mansoni adult worms in vitro when compared with either drug alone."}

Given the action of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in targeting tumors with deficiencies in this repair pathway by loss of BRCA1/2, ovarian tumors could be an attractive population for clinical application of this therapy. PARP inhibitors have moved into clinical practice in the past few years, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) within the past 2 years. The U.S. FDA approval of olaparib applies to fourth line treatment in germline BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer, and European EMA approval to olaparib maintenance in both germline and somatic BRCA-mutant platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In order to widen the ovarian cancer patient population that would benefit from PARP inhibitors, predictive biomarkers based on a clear understanding of the mechanism of action are required. Additionally, a better understanding of the toxicity profile is needed if PARP inhibitors are to be used in the curative, rather than the palliative, setting. We reviewed the development of PARP inhibitors in phase I-III clinical trials, including combination trials of PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy/antiangiogenics, the approval for these agents, the mechanisms of resistance, and the outstanding issues, including the development of biomarkers and the rate of long-term hematologic toxicities with these agents. ### Implications For Practice The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), with a second agent (rucaparib) likely to be approved in the near future.

The purpose of the present study was to confirm this interaction in vitro. ### methods A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to assay 4-chlorophenylbiguanide (4-CPBG) and cycloguanil formed from proguanil by microsomes prepared from human liver. The limit of detection was 0.08 nmol mg-'. h-I. ### results The formation of 4-CPBG and cycloguanil could be described by one-enzyme kinetics, indicating that the formation of the two metabolites is almost exclusively catalysed by a single enzyme, i.e. CYP2C19 within the concentration range used, or that the contribution of an alternative low-affinity enzyme, probably CYP3A4, is very low. This notion was confirmed by the lack of potent inhibition by four CYP3A4 inhibitors: ketoconazole, bromocriptine, midazolam and dihydroergotamine. Fluvoxamine was a very effective inhibitor of the oxidation of proguanil, displaying Ki values of 0.69 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of cycloguanil formation and 4.7 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of 4-CPBG formation. As expected, the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole inhibited the formation of both metabolites with an IC50 of 10 micromol x l(-1). Norfluoxetine and sulfaphenazole inhibited proguanil oxidation with Ki values of 7.3-16 micromol x l(-1), suggesting that the two compounds are moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19. ### conclusions Fluvoxamine is a fairly potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and it has the potential for causing drug-drug interactions with substrates for CYP2C19 such as imipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline and diazepam.

Searches were conducted using PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE, with supplemental searches using the Evidence Based Medicine Reviews and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs published in English from 1995-2016 and reporting at least one of the primary outcomes [overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, or quality of life] in patients who received first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool, respectively. A Baysian network meta-analysis was performed on the primary outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) were evaluated for the primary analysis; secondary analyses were conducted using median OS data.

The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performed two trials investigating paclitaxel/doxorubicin combinations in patients with advanced breast cancer in an attempt to identify a tolerable dose and schedule of the combination. In the first trial, paclitaxel and doxorubicin were alternated every 3 weeks in doses of 200 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2, respectively, for patients who had received no more than one prior chemotherapeutic regimen.

Patients received vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or glimepiride (up to 6 mg/day) added to metformin. ### results In all, 3118 patients were randomized (vildagliptin, n = 1562; glimepiride, n = 1556). From similar baseline values (7.3%), after 2 years adjusted mean (s.e.) change in HbA1c was comparable between vildagliptin and glimepiride treatment: -0.1% (0.0%) and -0.1% (0.0%), respectively. The primary objective of non-inferiority was met. A similar proportion of patients reached HbA1c <7% (36.9 and 38.3%, respectively), but with vildagliptin more patients reached this target without hypoglycaemia (36.0% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.004). The initial response (IR) was sustained for a mean (s.d.) of 309 (244) days with vildagliptin versus 270 (223) days for glimepiride (p < 0.001) (IR = nadir HbA1c where change from baseline > or =0.5% or HbA1c < or =6.5% within the first six months of treatment. After IR was detected, sustained response = time between nadir and an increase of >0.3% above IR). Independent of disease duration, age was a predictor of effect sustainability. Fewer patients experienced hypoglycaemia with vildagliptin (2.3% vs. 18.2% with glimepiride) with a 14-fold difference in the number of hypoglycaemic events (59 vs. 838). Vildagliptin had a beneficial effect on body weight [mean (s.e.) change from baseline -0.3 (0.1) kg; between-group difference -1.5 kg; p < 0.001]. Overall, both treatments were well tolerated and displayed similar safety profiles. ### conclusions Vildagliptin add-on has similar efficacy to glimepiride after 2 years' treatment, with markedly reduced hypoglycaemia risk and no weight gain."}

However, some patients may not be eligible for surgery due to comorbidities, and approximately 25\u00a0% of patients, especially those with CD, have recurrent disease. For these patients, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors may control cortisol elevation and subsequent symptomatology. CS is rare overall, and clinical studies of adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors are often small and, in many cases, data are limited regarding the efficacy and safety of these treatments.

When seven intermediate signal durations, to which responses were not reinforced, were randomly interspersed the probability of a right-lever ('long') response increased as a function of signal duration. Methamphetamine shifted this psychometric function leftward and decreased its slope: haloperidol also decreased the slope but shifted the function rightward. A combination of haloperidol and methamphetamine led to a function similar to the saline control function. The leftward shift probably reflects an increase in the speed of an internal clock, and the rightward shift probably reflects a decrease in its speed. Since methamphetamine releases several catecholamines, including dopamine, and haloperidol blocks dopamine receptors, it is plausible that the horizontal location of the psychometric function (the speed of the clock) is related to the effective level of dopamine."}

Following definitive treatment, patients were randomized to either cyclophosphamide 1 g/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks for 2 years, estramustine phosphate 600 mg/m2 orally daily for 2 years or to observation only. Accession closed in 1985 and included 184 patients in Protocol 900 (170 evaluable) and 253 in Protocol 1000 (233 evaluable). ### results Nodal involvement was identified in 198 patients (49% of total): 29% in Protocol 900 and 63% in protocol 1000. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and survival have been greater for patients in Protocol 900 regardless of adjuvant, reflecting their lower pathologic stage. Median PFS is significantly greater for patients in Protocol 1000 receiving estramustine (52.2 months) compared to cyclophosphamide (35.0 months). Median PFS for patients with nodal involvement in Protocol 1000 receiving estramustine is increased (43.5 months) compared to no treatment (21.5 months). Patients with limited nodal involvement in Protocol 1000 have a longer median PFS (45.6 months) compared to patients with extensive disease (23.6 months). But in the latter group patients receiving estramustine experienced a significantly longer median PFS (43.5 months) compared to cyclophosphamide (29.1 months) or no adjuvant (13.5 months). Increased PFS with estramustine adjuvant was also noted in stage C patients (only Protocol 900) and in those with high-grade (grade 3) tumors (both protocols). ### conclusions With now over 10 years mean follow-up for this series of patients, we conclude that adjuvant estramustine is beneficial for prostate cancer patients receiving definitive irradiation. This benefit is particularly noted in those patients with extensive nodal involvement (N+, D-1)."}

Thirty-six patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma were evaluable after treatment with preoperative chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin. Group 1 was comprised of 14 patients who empirically received r-HuEPO at a dose of 150 U/kg 3 times per week for 3 weeks; in patients deemed nonresponders, the dose was increased to 300 U/kg and 450 U/kg in the subsequent courses. Group 2 was comprised of 22 patients who did not receive r-HuEPO. ### results During preoperative chemotherapy, the mean hemoglobin fall was 0.5 g/dL in Group 1 (P = 0.40). In Group 2 there was a statistically significant mean hemoglobin fall of 3.3 g/dL (P < 0.0001). There was also a nonstatistically significant trend toward fewer PRBC transfusions: none of 14 patients (0%) in Group 1 versus 4 of 22 patients (18%) in Group 2 (P = 0.141). ### conclusions A significant fall in hemoglobin and an increase in the need for transfusions were observed in head and neck carcinoma patients receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy prior to surgery. Empiric r-HuEPO therapy appeared to prevent anemia and reduced the need for PRBC transfusions."}

LAB were identified phenotypically on basis of morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. Lactobacillus isolates were further confirmed using PCR-based assay. By combination of phenotypic with molecular identification Lactobacillus spp. were found to be the dominant genus (138, 76.7%) followed by Streptococcus spp. (65, 36.1%) and Lactococcus spp. (27, 15%). Some contaminant organisms such as (Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., mould and yeast) were isolated from the collected dairy samples but pharmaceutical products were free of such contaminants. Susceptibility of LAB isolates to antibiotics representing all major classes was tested by agar dilution method. Generally, LAB were highly susceptible to Beta-lactams except penicillin. Lactobacilli were resistant to vancomycin, however lactococci and streptococci proved to be very susceptible.

In the present investigation, through tissue microarray analysis, we report higher levels of folate receptor expression in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue derived from patients, which were minimal in normal tissue. For folate-receptor based targeted therapy of PCa, we generated novel planetary ball milled (PBM) nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with resveratrol (RES), and in combination with docetaxel (DTX) and conjugated with folic acid (FA) on the surface. The cytotoxic effect of FA-conjugated DTX-nanoparticles was found effectual that reduced the concentration of free drug (DTX) to 28 times. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells by 30.92% and 65.9% in the FA-conjugated RES and in combination with DTX nanoparticle formulation respectively. However, only 8.9% apoptotic cells were found with control (empty NP). The expressions of NF-kB p65, COX-2, pro (BAX, BAK) and anti-apoptotic (BCL-2, BCL-XL) genes were significantly reduced after treatment with FA-RES\u00a0+\u00a0DTX-NP. In addition, the FA-conjugated DTX formulation exhibited additional cytotoxic effects with the down-regulation of survivin and an increased expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 in PCa cells. Further, we observed that treating DTX resistant PCa cells with FA-RES\u00a0+\u00a0DTX-NP exhibited a reversal of the ABC-transporter markers thereby limiting the multidrug resistance phenotype of the cancer cells. Our results strongly suggested that FA conjugated nanoparticle drugs acted as effective inhibitors of drug efflux that effectually enhances the intracellular concentration of the drug to exhibit their cytotoxic effect."}

Here, we report 4-year survival and outcomes after retreatment, and the role of tumour mutational burden (TMB) in identifying patients who might have a better outcome in response to combined therapy. ### methods NIBIT-MESO-1 was an open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial of patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma who received intravenous tremelimumab (1 mg/kg bodyweight) and durvalumab (20 mg/kg bodyweight) every 4 weeks for four doses, followed by maintenance intravenous durvalumab at the same dose and schedule for nine doses. In this follow-up study, patients with disease progression following initial clinical benefit-ie, a partial repsonse or stable disease-were eligible for retreatment and with the same doses and schedules for tremelimumab and durvalumab as used in the NIBIT-MESO-1 trial. The primary endpoint, immune-related objective response rate, was evaluated per immune-related modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or immune-related RECIST 1.1 criteria for patients with pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma, respectively. Key secondary endpoints were overall survival and safety, and TMB was also evaluated post hoc in patients who had tumour tissue available before treatment. The intention-to-treat population was used for analysis of all efficacy endpoints. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02588131. ### findings 40 patients were enrolled in the NIBIT-MESO-1 study between Oct 30, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016. At data cut-off, April 30, 2020, five (13%) of 40 patients were alive, and 35 (88%) patients had died of progressive disease. At a median follow-up of 52 months (IQR 49-53), median overall survival was 16\u00b75 months (95% CI 13\u00b77-19\u00b72). Survival was 20% (eight of 40 patients) at 36 months and 15% (six of 40 patients) and 48 months. 17 (43%) of 40 patients met the criteria for enrolment in the retreatment study and were retreated with at least one dose of tremelimumab and durvalumab. No immune-related objective responses were observed in the 17 retreated patients. Seven (41%) of 17 patients achieved immune-related stable disease. From the start of retreatment to a median follow-up of 24 months (22\u00b70-25\u00b70), median overall survival was 12\u00b75 months (95% CI 0\u00b70-25\u00b78), and survival at 12 months was 52\u00b79%, at 18 months was 35\u00b73%, and at 24 months was 23\u00b75%. There were no grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the retreatment cohort. In a post-hoc analysis of 28 patients for whom tumour tissue before treatment was available, patients with a TMB higher than the median value of 8\u00b73 mutations per Mb had a higher median overall survival compared with patients with TMB below the median value, but this difference was non-significant. Moreover, when patients were additionally stratified for ICI retreatment (n=13), there was a significant difference in survival between those with a TMB higher than the median of 8\u00b73 mutations per Mb and those with TMB lower than the median in the retreated cohort (41\u00b73 months vs 17\u00b74 months; p=0\u00b702). ### interpretation Tremelimumab combined with durvalumab was associated with long-term survival in patients with mesothelioma. Retreatment was safe and resulted in clinically meaningful outcomes, thus suggesting its potential application in the clinical practice of mesothalioma patients. ### funding NIBIT Foundation, Fondazione AIRC, AstraZeneca."}

With a median follow-up of 14 months, a maximum follow-up of 19.5 months, and an expected median survival of 5-6 years on the IFN-alpha/cytarabine control arm, few of the expected progressions to accelerated or blast phase or deaths have occurred. Imatinib was also better tolerated. Edema, nausea, rigors, neutropenia, and headache were more frequent in women. Only 57% of the IFN-alpha target dose was administered, and only 68% of patients received any cytarabine.

Results of a population pharmacokinetic study in a subgroup of 371 patients and a separate rifampin-imatinib drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers are presented. ### conclusions On December 20, 2002, imatinib was granted accelerated approval under subpart H, rather than regular approval. Follow-up is short compared with the natural history of chronic phase CML or more mature results with established therapies such as IFN-alpha or transplantation. If imatinib should stop working after 1.5-2 years, the results could be importantly different from the present analysis.

Seven groups of recipient mice (n=10-28) received various combinations of the following treatment protocols: sirolimus, 1.5 mg/kg (3.0 mg/kg for xenografts) every other day from day 0 to day 12; cyclosporine, 50 mg/kg every other day from day 10 through 22; ALS, 0.5 ml on days -1 and 2 for allografts and days -1, 2, and 4 for xenografts; and BM, 25 million donor-specific cells IV on day 7. ### results The administration of ALS or ALS/BM resulted in modest but significant prolongation of skin graft survival in all combinations tested. Cyclosporine combined with ALS or ALS/BM significantly extended allograft survival compared with ALS or ALS/BM alone (P<0.05) but had no effect on xenograft survival. In contrast, the combination of sirolimus with ALS or ALS/BM resulted in a two- to threefold increase in allograft survival and over a fourfold increase in xenograft survival when compared with the comparable cyclosporine-based regimen. Additionally, lymphocytes isolated from class I and II incompatible mice with skin grafts surviving >100 days demonstrated markedly reduced interleukin 2 and interferon-gamma secretion in response to irradiated donor-specific lymphocytes in culture. ### conclusions In the regimens tested, sirolimus was superior to cyclosporine in augmenting donor BM-induced skin graft prolongation in ALS-treated mice across all levels of histoincompatibility."}

Two ADH1A variants showed statistically significant differences (odds ratio (OR)=5.68, P=0.0006; OR=5.35, P=0.0009) in allele frequencies between patients in complete/partial remission and patients without response, two substitutions on CYP2E1 (OR=0.13, P=0.001; OR=0.09, P=0.003) and one on SLCO1B1 (OR=4.68, P=0.002) were found to differently influence liver toxicity, and two nucleotide changes on SULTB1 and SLC22A12 genes correlated with response to GO (OR=0.24, P=0.0009; OR=2.75, P=0.0029).
