The aim of the second was to investigate whether \"ageing\", i.e. storage of the carrier, drug and blends under desiccation for more than 2 years, affected the aerodynamic properties of salbutamol sulphate powder formulations. Different formulations were prepared, each containing 1.5% (w/w) micronised salbutamol base or sulphate blended with the sieved fraction (63-90 microm) of one of the following sugars: alpha lactose monohydrate, sorbitol, maltose and dextrose. The salbutamol base blends were then stored unprotected at 75% RH (ambient temperature) and salbutamol fine particle fractions (FPFs) were measured by laser diffraction (LD) (% < 5.2 microm) and a multistage liquid impinger (MSLI) (% < 5.3 microm), following aerosolisation at 100 l min(-1) from a model glass inhaler, after storage of each formulation at the elevated conditions for 0, 1 and 6 days. Particle morphology and equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of each formulation prior to and after storage were also evaluated.

Exposure to 75% RH for 6 days resulted in a small reduction of salbutamol FPF from the lactose blend but drastic diminution of salbutamol FPFs from other blends. After exposure to the high RH, the lactose blend adsorbed ca. 0.4% whilst each of the other sugars took up larger quantities of water (15-40%) and underwent a marked change in the surface texture of the particles. \"Ageing\" of the carriers and/or formulations did not seem to alter the aerodynamic properties of the drug. \"Ageing\" of micronised salbutamol sulphate prior to blending, however, was found to improve the FPF of drug.

This study represents the first evidence of superior efficacy of targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone in the treatment of NSCLC. ZD6474 is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase. First evidences of antitumor activity and its excellent toxicity profile make it a promising targeted agent for the treatment of NSCLC. A recent phase I/II study examined the combination of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-TKI erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with non-squamous stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.

Carcinogens possess the ability to block apoptosis, and thus may induce development of cancers and resistance to therapy. Tobacco carcinogens have been studied widely; however, little is known about the agents that inhibit apoptosis, such as nicotine. We determine whether mitochondrial signaling mediates antiapoptotic effects of nicotine in lung cancer. A549 cells were exposed to nicotine (1 muM) followed by cisplatin (35 muM) plus etoposide (20 muM) for 24 hours. We found that nicotine prevented chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, improved cell survival, and caused modest increases in DNA synthesis. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt prevented the antiapoptotic effects of nicotine and decreased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Small interfering RNA MAPK kinase-1 blocked antiapoptotic effects of nicotine, whereas small interfering RNA MAPK kinase-2 blocked chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Nicotine prevented chemotherapy-induced reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-9 activation. Antiapoptotic effects of nicotine were blocked by mitochondrial anion channel inhibitor, 4,4'diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'disulfonic acid. Chemotherapy enhanced translocation of proapoptotic Bax to the mitochondria, whereas nicotine blocked these effects. Nicotine up-regulated Akt-mediated antiapoptotic X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and phosphorylated proapoptotic Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. The A549-rho0 cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, demonstrated partial resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, but blocked the antiapoptotic effects of nicotine. Accordingly, we provide evidence that nicotine modulates mitochondrial signaling and inhibits chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in lung cancer. The mitochondrial regulation of nicotine imposes an important mechanism that can critically impair the treatment of lung cancer, because many cancer-therapeutic agents induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial death pathway. Strategies aimed at understanding nicotine-mediated signaling may facilitate the development of improved therapies in lung cancer."}

Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases. One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi. The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever. There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical trial is in progress. Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment. For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation. These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied. Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection. In conclusion, our review re-emphasises the paradigm that activities mediated by lysosomotropic agents may offer an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide."}

Specifically, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and dapsone are now widely used in PV. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, and most recently, rituximab, are other members of the therapeutic armamentarium. However, despite the widening range of treatment options in PV, well-controlled clinical trials and consensus guidelines are lacking. "}

There is currently no consensus on the most suitable treatment for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation. This open, multicenter, retrospective, uncontrolled cohort study was designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combined use of a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor and sorafenib in this setting. In 31 patients who suffered from HCC recurrence after liver transplantation, the immunosuppressive therapy was changed to mTOR inhibitors, and systemic treatment with sorafenib was initiated. This combination was maintained until symptomatic tumor progression, death, hepatic decompensation, or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Primary treatment efficacy was determined by overall survival and progression-free survival, and secondary efficacy was determined by the overall response rate. Toxicity parameters associated with the use of sorafenib and mTOR inhibitors were also analyzed. The overall response rate according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was 3.8% (1/26), and there was sustained stabilization of the disease in 13 additional cases (50.0%). The median overall survival was 19.3 months [95% confidence interval (CI) = 13.4-25.1 months], and the median time to progression was 6.77 months (95% CI = 2.3-11.1 months). Only 2 grade 3/4 cases of hyperglycemia and 1 case of grade 3/4 mucositis were reported, and they were possibly related to mTOR inhibitors. The most common severe adverse event probably related to sorafenib was diarrhea (12.9%). In conclusion, the coadministration of sorafenib and an mTOR inhibitor could be effective despite notable toxicity in patients with post-liver transplant HCC recurrence not suitable for radical therapy. The toxicity and efficacy need to be further evaluated in randomized controlled studies for this combination to be considered a valid option."}

All experiments were performed in 18-week-old female spontaneously hypertensive rats arranged in three experimental groups: intact; ovariectomized (OVX); and ovariectomized plus treatment with 17beta-oestradiol (OVX + E2). These groups were used to evaluate the effects of captopril administration alone, or following bradykinin B2 receptor blockade or nitric oxide synthase inhibition, on a number of haemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, vascular resistance and heart rate). The drop in mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance index in response to captopril was more pronounced in intact and ovariectomized rats treated with 17beta-oestradiol than in ovariectomized animals. Blockade of bradykinin B2 receptors or inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis attenuated the synergy between 17beta-oestradiol and captopril. It is concluded that ovariectomy blunted the blood pressure and vascular resistance index drop observed in intact rats in response to captopril. Treatment with 17beta-oestradiol prevented the blunted response to captopril in ovariectomized rats. Kinins and nitric oxide may be involved in the mechanisms of 17beta-oestradiol potentiation of the haemodynamic effects of captopril."}

We investigated the pharmacokinetics of carboplatin in Japanese prostate cancer patients (n=10, 55-72 years), and evaluated the usefulness of Calvert's formula in the individualized dosing adjustment. They were intravenously administered carboplatin (area under the free plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)=5 mg.min/ml), following the intravenous administration of paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)). The dosage of carboplatin for each patient was determined with Calvert's formula using individual creatinine clearance values. Plasma concentration of total platinum was measured sequentially and the pharmacokinetic parameters of carboplatin were determined in each patient. Plasma concentration of total carboplatin after intravenous infusion well fitted the two-compartment model. Carboplatin clearance was 62.0+/-12.7 ml/min (mean+/-S.D.), and linearly related to the individual creatinine clearance (r(2)=0.64, p<0.01). The actual AUC for total carboplatin was 8.20+/-1.11 mg.min/ml, and its inter-individual variability was decreased to 65% of that in carboplatin clearance, indicating the effectiveness of Calvert's formula for dosage adjustment of carboplatin. Leucopenia of grade 4 according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria was found in one patient, but no patient demonstrated thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, determining carboplatin dosage based on Calvert's formula decreased the inter-individual variability in the actual AUC compared with that in the carboplatin clearance, and a target AUC of 5 mg.min/ml of carboplatin was comparatively safe for Japanese patients with prostate cancer."}

A fiftyseven year-old man five months after liver transplantation was initiated on hepatitis C triple therapy with PEG-INF \u03b1, ribavirin and telaprevir.

A liver biopsy failed to show histological evidence of primary biliary cirrhosis or graft rejection. He was initiated on urseodeoxycholic acid with subsequent improvement of his liver enzymes. This case demonstrates that despite adequate immunosuppression, AMA seroconversion may occur post-transplant during interferon-based therapy. As AMA seroconversion did not occur during the pre-transplant PEG-IFN therapy, we speculate that donor allograft antigens in combination with PEG-IFN may have been a factor in the post-transplant seroconversion.
