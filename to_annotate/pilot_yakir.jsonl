The current treatment of TB needs daily administration of combined drug therapy for six or more months. Sometime non-adherence and less bioavailability from current therapy develops multidrug resistance, as a result, high dose requirement and subsequent intolerable toxicity are seen. Therefore, nanotechnology gained special attention as it has potential to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduction in dosing frequency. ### objective The aim of this study is to fabricate alginate-chitosan nanoparticles (AL-CS NPs) under appropriate conditions using ionic gelation method. The use of natural polymers in nanoparticle fabrication has a vast application due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility and nontoxic nature. Ionic gelation method involves the interaction between macromolecules with opposite charged ionizable groups forming polyelectrolyte complex. Hence, it is rational to formulate natural polymerbased sustained release nano-particulate matrix to improve patient adherence, reducing dose frequency and drug toxicity. ### method The formulations were based on 32 factorial designs. Nanoparticles of combined drug (Isoniazid- INH and Pyrazinamide-PYZ) were fabricated using natural polymer. Formulation process involved the use of pregelated sodium alginate followed by ionic gelation with chitosan. Pregelation of sodium alginate included calcium chloride. The effects of sodium alginate concentration and chitosan concentration on particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release were studied. ### results Optimized Batch-3s showed particle size 539.7 \u00b1 2.33 nm, zeta potential -26.4 \u00b1 0.55 mV, and entrapment efficiency is 70.21 \u00b1 0.24% and 73.45 \u00b1 0.21% of INH and PYZ, respectively.

When used alone, gentamicin had negligible effects on the bacteria but significantly reduced the MICs of penicillin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 11, 10, and 3, of the 15 strains of the B. melaninogenicus group, respectively. The 15 strains of the B. fragilis group were all beta-lactamase producers and were highly resistant to penicillin or the combination of penicillin and gentamicin. However, gentamicin reduced the MICs of clindamycin and metronidazole against 1 and 7 strains of this group, respectively. The in vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the sizes and bacterial content of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspensions. The results of the in vivo tests were generally consistent with those obtained in vitro with strains of the B. melaninogenicus group. Synergism between gentamicin and penicillin, clindamycin, or metronidazole was shown in 13, 10, and 3 strains of this group, respectively. In vivo synergism was not clearly demonstrated with the strains of the B. fragilis group, possibly because clindamycin and metronidazole used alone were highly efficacious. We suggest that the synergistic effect of gentamicin is due to its increased transport into the bacterial cell in the presence of penicillin and, possibly, other antimicrobial agents. The newly recognized in vitro and in vivo synergism between penicillin and other antimicrobial agents and an aminoglycoside in B. melaninogenicus may have clinical implications that deserve to be investigated."}

The observed level of antitumor activity, with an overall response rate of 38% and a median duration of response of 12 months, is of interest, since the study was targeted only to anthracycline-pretreated patients, most of whom had adverse prognostic features. The evaluation of a combination of vinorelbine and paclitaxel as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer seems worthwhile and is currently undergoing."}

Cells were harvested 30min-48h after treatment and whole cell lysates were analyzed using immunoblots or luciferase assays. ### results Treatment of cells with leptin resulted in activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and subsequent phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on LRb, followed by dose- and time-dependent increases in the expression of Frizzled-1 (FZD1) and Frizzled-7 (FZD7). Leptin-mediated increases in the expression of FZD1 were blocked by pre-treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the JAK2 inhibitor AG490. Experiments using a series of hybrid Epo extracellular domain-leptin intracellular domain receptors (ELR) harboring mutations of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail showed that increases in the expression of FZD1 were dependent on LRb-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3, but not ERK1/2 or STAT5. Leptin pre-treatment of chondrocytes prior to Wnt3a stimulation resulted in an increased magnitude of canonical Wnt signaling. ### conclusion These experiments show that leptin-LRb signaling in articular chondrocytes modulates expression of canonical Wnt signaling receptors and suggests that direct cross-talk between these pathways is important in determining chondrocyte homeostasis."}

The median follow-up was 30.5 months. Twenty-two patients (58%) achieved a partial radiographic response, and 32 patients (84%) achieved disease control at 6 months. Four patients had sufficient response to undergo resection, and 1 patient had a complete pathologic response. The median PFS was 11.8 months (1-sided 90% CI, 11.1) with a 6-month PFS rate of 84.1% (90% CI, 74.8%-infinity), thereby meeting the primary end point (6-month PFS rate, 80%). The median OS was 25.0 months (95% CI, 20.6-not reached), and the 1-year OS rate was 89.5% (95% CI, 80.2%-99.8%). Patients with resectable regional lymph nodes (18 [47%]) showed no difference in OS compared with patients with node-negative disease (24-month OS: lymph node negative: 60%; 95% CI, 40%-91% vs lymph node positive: 50%; 95% CI, 30%-83%; P\u2009=\u2009.66). Four patients (11%) had grade 4 toxic effects requiring removal from the study (1 portal hypertension, 2 gastroduodenal artery aneurysms, 1 infection in the pump pocket). Subgroup analysis showed significant improvement in survival in patients with IDH1/2 mutated tumors (2-year OS, 90%; 95% CI, 73%-99%) vs wild-type (2-year OS, 33%; 95% CI, 18%-63%) (P\u2009=\u2009.01). In the Washington University in St Louis confirmatory cohort, 9 patients (90%) achieved disease control at 6 months; the most common grade 3 toxic effect was elevated results of liver function tests, and median PFS was 12.8 months (1-sided 90% CI, 6.4). ### Conclusions And Relevance Hepatic arterial infusion plus systemic chemotherapy appears to be highly active and tolerable in patients with unresectable IHC; further evaluation is warranted."}

Twenty-four months later, she was diagnosed with multiple bone metastases and underwent chemotherapy with paclitaxel and bevacizumab. Thirty-three months after the initiation of the chemotherapy, she noticed bilateral blurred vision. The retinal thickening with macular edema was observed by optical coherence tomography, resulting in a diagnosis of CME. With cessation of paclitaxel and administrating ocular instillation of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, her macular edema gradually reduced and disappeared in a month. While CME caused by chemotherapy is very rare, taxane may cause ocular adverse events such as CME. It is important to urge patients to consult an ophthalmologist promptly when they have visual complaints during taxane chemotherapy."}

We performed a phase II study of third-line chemotherapy with combined bevacizumab and S-1 for mCRC. ### methods Subjects were mCRC patients with mutated KRAS who showed disease aggravation even after two regimens with oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Bevacizumab was given intravenously every 2 weeks, and S-1 was administered orally on days 1-28 of a 42-day cycle. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR). ### results In total, 31 subjects were enrolled between August 2009 and June 2011. Three subjects in whom antitumor effects could not be evaluated were excluded. The median follow-up period was 8.6 months. The DCR was 67.9%, the response rate 0%, median progression-free survival 3.7 months, and overall survival 8.6 months. In 30 subjects evaluated for safety, there was no treatment-related death. The most common adverse events were anorexia (grade \u22653, 20%), diarrhea (grade 3, 10%), and decreased hemoglobin (grade \u22653, 17%). ### conclusions The results suggest that third-line chemotherapy with combined bevacizumab and S-1 is safe and may delay the progression of mCRC resistant to oxaliplatin and irinotecan with mutated KRAS."}

Iloperidone is a promising, novel atypical neuroleptic drug (NL), for which no cognitive data is presently available. ### objective To investigate whether the novel atypical NL iloperidone would affect performance of rats on a WM test, using a delayed non-matching-to-position (DNMTP) paradigm, and compare its effects with those of the atypical NL clozapine and the typical NL haloperidol. ### methods Male Lister Hooded rats trained to criterion in an operant DNMTP task (0-64 s delay intervals) were administered vehicle, iloperidone (0.03, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), clozapine (0.1, 0.3 mg/kg, s.c.), haloperidol (0.003, 0.01, 0.03 mg/kg, s.c.), or scopolamine (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.). Together with choice accuracy, the motor performance of the task was measured. ### results It was found that: (1) iloperidone significantly improved choice accuracy delay-dependently while impairing task performance; (2) the atypical NL clozapine had no effect on choice accuracy and parameters related to motor function, but significantly increased the number of uncompleted trials; (3) haloperidol did not affect choice accuracy except at the longest delay with the highest dose, but in contrast to clozapine it significantly impaired task performance. ### conclusion In accordance with their different pharmacological profiles, the three NLs iloperidone, clozapine, and haloperidol have different effects in this preclinical cognitive task. These results might provide important information for the development of NLs with beneficial effects on cognition."}

Our re-analysis relied on standard equivalence methods in which interpretation is based on Relative Risks (RRs) along with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The equivalence margins employed in our statistical testing were directly derived from those reported in randomized studies. ### results The equivalence margins were initially set at RR ranging from 0.775 to 1.29. According to these margins, triple therapy based on any NOAC proved to be superior to dual therapy alone, but at the same time demonstrated its equivalence with dual therapy.

In the comparison between rivaroxaban-based triple therapy and ticagrelor + aspirin, the RR was 1 and its 95% CI remained within a post-hoc margin of \u00b1 15%. ### conclusions Even if one considers the most effective NOAC in combination with clopidogrel + ticagrelor, this triple therapy is not more effective than ticagrelor + aspirin. On the other hand, the increased risk of bleeding with triple regimens is well demonstrated. We therefore conclude that these triple regimens did not play any important roles in the patients experiencing an acute coronary syndrome."}

The mean survival time to progression following the second line of treatment amounted to 5.85 and 6.2 months respectively. Statistically, a higher number of patients in good condition of 0 to 1 was documented in the group responding to treatment. Significant correlation was documented between primary stage of the disease and time to progression in patients treated with capecitabine (p = 0.0258). The recurrence of the disease was observed in 44/45 patients following operation with radical intention but with an insufficient number of excised lymph nodes. A significantly longer time to progression was observed in women treated with capecitabine. In logistic regression, lack of treatment response was found to be an independent factor affecting the time to disease progression. Patients who did not respond to the second line of treatment demonstrated a significantly shorter time to disease progression than patients who responded to it and they showed a significantly higher number of patients with leucopenia during treatment. ### conclusions Clinical response to treatment in both treated groups is of significant importance for the probability of local recurrence of the disease, preservation of a good patient's condition and the higher level of leukocytes during treatment."}
