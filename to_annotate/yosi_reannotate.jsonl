The mean survival time to progression following the second line of treatment amounted to 5.85 and 6.2 months respectively. Statistically, a higher number of patients in good condition of 0 to 1 was documented in the group responding to treatment. Significant correlation was documented between primary stage of the disease and time to progression in patients treated with capecitabine (p = 0.0258). The recurrence of the disease was observed in 44/45 patients following operation with radical intention but with an insufficient number of excised lymph nodes. A significantly longer time to progression was observed in women treated with capecitabine. In logistic regression, lack of treatment response was found to be an independent factor affecting the time to disease progression. Patients who did not respond to the second line of treatment demonstrated a significantly shorter time to disease progression than patients who responded to it and they showed a significantly higher number of patients with leucopenia during treatment. ### conclusions Clinical response to treatment in both treated groups is of significant importance for the probability of local recurrence of the disease, preservation of a good patient's condition and the higher level of leukocytes during treatment."}

The current treatment of TB needs daily administration of combined drug therapy for six or more months. Sometime non-adherence and less bioavailability from current therapy develops multidrug resistance, as a result, high dose requirement and subsequent intolerable toxicity are seen. Therefore, nanotechnology gained special attention as it has potential to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduction in dosing frequency. ### objective The aim of this study is to fabricate alginate-chitosan nanoparticles (AL-CS NPs) under appropriate conditions using ionic gelation method. The use of natural polymers in nanoparticle fabrication has a vast application due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility and nontoxic nature. Ionic gelation method involves the interaction between macromolecules with opposite charged ionizable groups forming polyelectrolyte complex. Hence, it is rational to formulate natural polymerbased sustained release nano-particulate matrix to improve patient adherence, reducing dose frequency and drug toxicity. ### method The formulations were based on 32 factorial designs. Nanoparticles of combined drug (Isoniazid- INH and Pyrazinamide-PYZ) were fabricated using natural polymer. Formulation process involved the use of pregelated sodium alginate followed by ionic gelation with chitosan. Pregelation of sodium alginate included calcium chloride. The effects of sodium alginate concentration and chitosan concentration on particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release were studied. ### results Optimized Batch-3s showed particle size 539.7 \u00b1 2.33 nm, zeta potential -26.4 \u00b1 0.55 mV, and entrapment efficiency is 70.21 \u00b1 0.24% and 73.45 \u00b1 0.21% of INH and PYZ, respectively. Dissolution release study of Batch-3s in 7.4 pH phosphate buffer exhibited the initial burst of 5.04 \u00b10.45% and 19.68 \u00b1 0.87% at 0.25 hrs followed by slow, sustained release of drug 74.53 \u00b1 2.53 and 57.87 \u00b1 2.04% at 10 hrs of INH and PYZ, respectively. ### conclusion It concluded that chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (AL) concentration are rate-limiting factors in formulation development. Natural polymer based combined drug nano-particulate system could be an innovative and optimistic approach in the treatment of TB."}

Our re-analysis relied on standard equivalence methods in which interpretation is based on Relative Risks (RRs) along with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).

The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as effective as standard NSAIDs for the relief of pain and for improving function in elderly patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of serious gastroduodenal adverse reactions but there is evidence that they carry a lower risk for these adverse effects than standard NSAIDs, except when there is concurrent aspirin use. Since gastroduodenal disorders are the most frequently reported serious adverse effects of NSAIDs and these disorders occur more frequently in the elderly, COX-2 inhibitors offer an alternative to standard NSAIDs in this age group. However, they are not appropriate for many patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. The adverse reaction profile of the COX-2 inhibitors has confirmed the role of the COX-2 enzyme in renal function, salt and water homeostasis and the vascular endothelium. Thus, like standard NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause renal failure, hypertension and exacerbation of cardiac failure. Of note is that these disorders are dose related. Thus, there are good reasons to avoid high doses of COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly.

Recent research indicates that COX-2 inhibitors have a thrombotic potential, especially in high doses and when use is prolonged, and this further limits the extent to which they can be used in the elderly. Important interactions with COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly include those with warfarin, which can result in loss of control of anticoagulation, and those with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists and diuretics, which can result in loss of control of blood pressure and cardiac failure and, in hypovolaemic conditions, renal failure. The clinical significance of an interaction between celecoxib and aspirin to reduce the antiplatelet effect of the latter drug is unknown. Preliminary information from spontaneous reporting systems indicates that there may be differences in the risk of cardiac failure and hypertension between standard NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors and between rofecoxib and celecoxib. More formal studies using equivalent doses are needed to test this observation. Use of COX-2 inhibitors may be considered in the elderly to reduce the risk of gastroduodenal complications associated with standard NSAIDs but only when consideration has first been given to use of less toxic medicines as alternatives or supplements, the appropriate dose of the COX-2 inhibitor or standard NSAID, the presence and possible impact of co-morbidities, and the implications of taking COX-2 inhibitors with any concomitant medications. Equally important is regular monitoring of the patient taking a COX-2 inhibitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and ensuring that the patient has a continuing need to keep taking the drug. Close attention also needs to be paid to intercurrent illnesses and new prescriptions that may reduce the safety of the COX-2 inhibitor. A standard NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor may be equally effective as a COX-2 inhibitor in reducing the risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and if used the same prescribing advice applies. Current knowledge concerning the thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors suggests that this combination, if tolerated, may be preferable to a COX-2 inhibitor, particularly where prolonged use is required. This knowledge also indicates that for patients with or at high risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke, COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated.", "abstract": "Chronic pain in the elderly is frequently a result of arthritic disorders, particularly osteoarthritis.

Important interactions with COX-2 inhibitors in the elderly include those with warfarin, which can result in loss of control of anticoagulation, and those with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists and diuretics, which can result in loss of control of blood pressure and cardiac failure and, in hypovolaemic conditions, renal failure. The clinical significance of an interaction between celecoxib and aspirin to reduce the antiplatelet effect of the latter drug is unknown. Preliminary information from spontaneous reporting systems indicates that there may be differences in the risk of cardiac failure and hypertension between standard NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors and between rofecoxib and celecoxib. More formal studies using equivalent doses are needed to test this observation. Use of COX-2 inhibitors may be considered in the elderly to reduce the risk of gastroduodenal complications associated with standard NSAIDs but only when consideration has first been given to use of less toxic medicines as alternatives or supplements, the appropriate dose of the COX-2 inhibitor or standard NSAID, the presence and possible impact of co-morbidities, and the implications of taking COX-2 inhibitors with any concomitant medications. Equally important is regular monitoring of the patient taking a COX-2 inhibitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and ensuring that the patient has a continuing need to keep taking the drug. Close attention also needs to be paid to intercurrent illnesses and new prescriptions that may reduce the safety of the COX-2 inhibitor. A standard NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor may be equally effective as a COX-2 inhibitor in reducing the risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and if used the same prescribing advice applies. Current knowledge concerning the thrombotic potential of COX-2 inhibitors suggests that this combination, if tolerated, may be preferable to a COX-2 inhibitor, particularly where prolonged use is required. This knowledge also indicates that for patients with or at high risk of ischaemic heart disease or stroke, COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated."}

The in vitro tests consisted of determinations of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) carried out with or without constant amounts of gentamicin. When used alone, gentamicin had negligible effects on the bacteria but significantly reduced the MICs of penicillin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 11, 10, and 3, of the 15 strains of the B. melaninogenicus group, respectively. The 15 strains of the B. fragilis group were all beta-lactamase producers and were highly resistant to penicillin or the combination of penicillin and gentamicin. However, gentamicin reduced the MICs of clindamycin and metronidazole against 1 and 7 strains of this group, respectively. The in vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the sizes and bacterial content of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspensions. The results of the in vivo tests were generally consistent with those obtained in vitro with strains of the B. melaninogenicus group. Synergism between gentamicin and penicillin, clindamycin, or metronidazole was shown in 13, 10, and 3 strains of this group, respectively. In vivo synergism was not clearly demonstrated with the strains of the B. fragilis group, possibly because clindamycin and metronidazole used alone were highly efficacious. We suggest that the synergistic effect of gentamicin is due to its increased transport into the bacterial cell in the presence of penicillin and, possibly, other antimicrobial agents. The newly recognized in vitro and in vivo synergism between penicillin and other antimicrobial agents and an aminoglycoside in B. melaninogenicus may have clinical implications that deserve to be investigated."}

ECOG performance status 0/1/2 was 29, 58, and 13%. Median age was 66.5 years (range: 41.3-83.1), 94% were white, and 50.7% were female. ### results Between August 2000 and February 2002, 69 patients with ESCLC were enrolled. All 69 patients were included in the safety analysis, and 66 patients were evaluable for response. There were 2 CR (3.0%), 26 PR (39.5%), 23 SD (34.8%), and 15 PD (22.7%) resulting in a RR of 42.5%. The median survival was 9.2 months (range: <1-22.6), and the estimated 1-year survival was 33%. The median TTP was 3.9 months (range: <1-12.8), and the estimated 6-month progression free survival was 24%. The median duration of response was 3.8 months (range: 1.0-9.9). Out of 69 patients, 29, 3, and 16 received 4, 5, and 6 cycles of therapy, respectively. The major Grade 3, 4 toxicities included neutropenia (39.1%), thrombocytopenia (31.9%), anemia (13.0%), and fatigue (4.3%). ### conclusion This regimen resulted in survival data that was similar to other regimens for ESCLC and treatment appeared to be well tolerated. Gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin or other active drugs in ESCLC may be worth further investigation."}
