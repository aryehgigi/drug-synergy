For patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation who experience resistance via ERBB2 amplification, no targeted drug has been demonstrated to be effective. ### Patient Concerns A 56-year-old female nonsmoker suffered from left leg paralysis and low back pain. Imaging examination revealed a mass in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe lung and possible multiple metastases in the right hilar, mediastinal lymph nodes, bone metastases, and soft tissue invasion. ### diagnosis Transbronchial lung biopsy revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (cT4N2M1c, stage IV). An EGFR exon 19 deletion was identified using amplification refractory mutation system. ### interventions After the patient was treated with gefitinib initiation (250\u200amg/d) for 15\u200amonths, the tumor progressed with ERBB2 amplification revealed by next-generation sequencing test. Then, the patient was started on afatinib (40\u200amg/d) plus bevacizumab (7.5\u200amg/kg every 3\u200aweeks). ### outcomes The combination therapy of afatinib and bevacizumab in this patient was effective with some slight side effects. Computed tomography scans showed the tumor shrinkage and the pleural effusion disappeared in the right lung. The overall survival was 23.5\u200amonths. ### conclusion To date, there is no targeted therapy approved and demonstrated to be effective for non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR sensitizing mutations, and ERBB2 amplification. The effectiveness of combination therapy with afatinib and bevacizumab may provide a new therapeutic option for these patients."}

Prior reports have suggested diminished responses to sequential lines of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies, but it is unknown whether subsequent taxane-based chemotherapy may be more effective than sequential AR-targeting treatment. We sought to evaluate the clinical activity of enzalutamide versus docetaxel in men with mCRPC who progressed on abiraterone. ### methods We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of consecutive mCRPC patients who had progressed on abiraterone therapy and subsequently received either enzalutamide (n=30) or docetaxel (n=31). We evaluated clinical outcomes including prostate-specific antigen decline of >30% (PSA30) or >50% (PSA50), PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and clinical/radiographic PFS. We performed multivariable modeling to control for baseline and on-treatment differences between groups. ### results Compared to subjects who received enzalutamide post-abiraterone, subjects who received docetaxel post-abiraterone had more bone metastases, more visceral metastases, higher baseline PSA, and had more frequent PSA tests while on-treatment. There were no significant differences in PSA30 (41% for enzalutamide vs. 53% for docetaxel) or PSA50 (34% vs. 40%) response rates between the two groups; there remained no difference after stratifying by presence/absence of prior response to abiraterone. Median PSA-PFS was 4.1 versus 4.1 months for the enzalutamide and docetaxel cohorts, respectively (HR 1.35, 95% CI, 0.53-3.66, P=0.502). Median PFS was 4.7 versus 4.4 months, respectively (HR 1.44, 95% CI, 0.77-2.71, P=0.257). PSA-PFS and PFS did not differ after stratifying by prior response to abiraterone. In multivariable analyses, there were no significant differences in PSA-PFS or PFS between the two groups. ### conclusions Treatment with either enzalutamide or docetaxel produced modest PSA responses and PFS intervals in this abiraterone-pretreated mCRPC population. In this retrospective study with small sample size, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between groups. Therefore, either enzalutamide or docetaxel may be a reasonable option in men who have progressed on abiraterone."}

Abstracts from recent meetings, including the International AIDS Society, Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, were reviewed for relevant abstracts and poster presentations. ### Data Synthesis Pharmacokinetic studies evaluating the concurrent use of tenofovir and didanosine have been performed in healthy volunteers. Tenofovir 300 mg administered concurrently with 400 mg didanosine results in a 48-64% increase in the didanosine maximum plasma concentration and AUC with no significant alterations in the tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters.

The results demonstrated equivalent didanosine AUCs. ### conclusions When used concurrently, tenofovir significantly increases the maximum plasma concentration and the AUC of didanosine. Additional data in HIV-infected patients are needed to determine the long-term toxicities of this combination therapy. Didanosine dose reduction should be considered when these 2 agents are used concurrently."}

At the licensed dose, the numbers needed to treat (NNTs) (95% CI) required to produce an American College for Rheumatology (ACR) response compared with placebo were: ACR20: adalimumab 3.6 (3.1 to 4.2), etanercept 2.1 (1.9 to 2.4), infliximab 3.2 (2.7 to 4.0); ACR50: adalimumab 4.2 (3.7 to 5.0), etanercept 3.1 (2.7 to 3.6), infliximab 5.0 (3.8 to 6.7); and ACR70: adalimumab 7.7 (5.9 to 11.1), etanercept 7.7 (6.3 to 10.0), infliximab 11.1 (7.7 to 20.0). In patients who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, or who had not previously failed methotrexate treatment, a TNF inhibitor combined with methotrexate was significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. Infliximab combined with methotrexate had an increased risk of serious infections.

For use in accordance with current NICE guidance as the third DMARD in a sequence of DMARDs, the base-case ICER was around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in early RA and pound50,000 per QALY in late RA. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to the estimates of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) progression while on TNF inhibitors and the effectiveness of DMARDs, but not to changes in mortality ratios per unit HAQ. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used last. The ICER for etanercept used last is pound24,000 per QALY, substantially lower than for adalimumab ( pound30,000 per QALY) or infliximab ( pound38,000 per QALY). First line use as monotherapy generates ICERs around pound50,000 per QALY for adalimumab and etanercept.

Meta-analyses of effectiveness data were also undertaken for each agent. The Birmingham Rheumatoid Arthritis Model (BRAM), a simulation model, was further developed and used to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. ### results Twenty-nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of high quality, were included. The only head-to-head comparisons were against methotrexate. For patients with short disease duration (<or=3 years) who were na\u00efve to methotrexate, adalimumab was marginally less and etanercept was marginally more effective than methotrexate in reducing symptoms of RA. Etanercept was better tolerated than methotrexate. Both adalimumab and etanercept were more effective than methotrexate in slowing radiographic joint damage. Etanercept was also marginally more effective and better tolerated than methotrexate in patients with longer disease durations who had not failed methotrexate treatment. Infliximab is only licensed for use with methotrexate.

Using the combination of methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor as first line treatment generates much higher ICERs, as it precludes subsequent use of methotrexate, which is cheap. The ICERs for sequential use are of the same order as using the TNF inhibitor alone. ### conclusions Adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are effective treatments compared with placebo for RA patients who are not well controlled by conventional DMARDs, improving control of symptoms, improving physical function, and slowing radiographic changes in joints. The combination of a TNF inhibitor with methotrexate was more effective than methotrexate alone in early RA, although the clinical relevance of this additional benefit is yet to be established, particularly in view of the well-established effectiveness of MTX alone. An increased risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out for the combination of methotrexate with adalimumab or infliximab. The results of the economic evaluation based on BRAM are consistent with the observations from the review of clinical effectiveness, including the ranking of treatments. TNF inhibitors are most cost-effective when used as last active therapy. In this analysis, other things being equal, etanercept may be the TNF inhibitor of choice, although this may also depend on patient preference as to route of administration. The next most cost-effective use of TNF inhibitors is third line, as recommended in the 2002 NICE guidance. Direct comparative RCTs of TNF inhibitors against each other and against other DMARDs, and sequential use in patients who have failed a previous TNF inhibitor, are needed. Longer term studies of the quality of life in patients with RA and the impact of DMARDs on this are needed, as are longer studies that directly assess effects on joint replacement, other morbidity and mortality."}

The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab compared with sunitinib for first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC from the U.S. payer perspective. ### Materials And Methods A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab with those of sunitinib in the first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates in 2017. We extrapolated survival beyond the trial closure using Weibull distribution. Model robustness was addressed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. ### results The total mean cost per-patient of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib was $292,308 and $169,287, respectfully. Nivolumab and ipilimumab generated a gain of 0.978 QALYs over sunitinib. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for nivolumab and ipilimumab was $125,739/QALY versus sunitinib. ### conclusion Our analysis established that the base case ICER in the model for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib is below what some would consider the upper limit of the theoretical willingness-to-pay threshold in the U.S. ($150,000/QALY) and is thus estimated to be cost-effective. ### Implications For Practice This article assessed the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib for treatment of patients with intermediate- to poor-risk metastatic kidney cancer, from the U.S. payer perspective. It would cost $125,739 to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib in these patients."}

Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the molecular effects of PZQ on schistosomes and to investigate alternative or synergistic drugs against schistosomiasis. ### methodology We used a custom-designed Schistosoma mansoni expression microarray to explore the effects of sublethal doses of PZQ on large-scale gene expression of adult paired males and females and unpaired mature females. We also assessed the efficacy of PZQ, omeprazole (OMP) or their combination against S. mansoni adult worms with a survival in vitro assay. ### Principal Findings We identified sets of genes that were affected by PZQ in paired and unpaired mature females, however with opposite gene expression patterns (up-regulated in paired and down-regulated in unpaired mature females), indicating that PZQ effects are heavily influenced by the mating status. We also identified genes that were similarly affected by PZQ in males and females. Functional analyses of gene interaction networks were performed with parasite genes that were differentially expressed upon PZQ treatment, searching for proteins encoded by these genes whose human homologs are targets of different drugs used for other diseases. Based on these results, OMP, a widely prescribed proton pump inhibitor known to target the ATP1A2 gene product, was chosen and tested. Sublethal doses of PZQ combined with OMP significantly increased worm mortality in vitro when compared with PZQ or OMP alone, thus evidencing a synergistic effect. ### conclusions Functional analysis of gene interaction networks is an important approach that can point to possible novel synergistic drug candidates. We demonstrated the potential of this strategy by showing that PZQ in combination with OMP displayed increased efficiency against S. mansoni adult worms in vitro when compared with either drug alone."}

As validation, a hospital cohort of patients with CHB treated with entecavir (n\u2009=\u20091560) or tenofovir (n\u2009=\u20091141) in a tertiary referral center between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016, were analyzed. Nationwide cohort data were retrieved from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016, and hospital cohort data from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2017. ### Main Outcomes And Measures Cumulative incidence rates of HCC and death and transplant rates. ### results Among the population cohort of 24\u202f156, the mean (SD) age was 48.9 (9.8) years, and 15\u202f120 patients (62.6%) were male. Among the hospital cohort of 2701, the mean (SD) age was 48.8 (10.5) years and 1657 patients (61.3%) were male. In the population cohort, the annual incidence rate of HCC was significantly lower in the tenofovir group (0.64 per 100 person-years [PY]) than in the entecavir group (1.06 per 100 PY). By multivariable-adjusted analysis, tenofovir therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of HCC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.70) and all-cause mortality or transplant (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65-0.92) compared with entecavir. The tenofovir group also showed a significantly lower risk of HCC in the 10\u202f923-pair propensity score-matched population cohort (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.70) and 869-pair propensity score-matched hospital cohort (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-0.99) compared with the entecavir group. ### Conclusions And Relevance This study suggests that tenofovir treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of HCC compared with entecavir treatment in a population-based cohort of adults with CHB; these findings were validated in a hospital cohort. Given the poor prognosis of patients with HCC, these findings may have considerable clinical implications in prevention of this cancer in patients with CHB infection."}

High performance liquid chromatography was used to measure intracellular daunorubicin accumulation. ### results AML blasts and progenitors from patients who achieved complete remission were more sensitive to both CPX-351 and free drugs than the same cells from patients with chemotherapy refractory leukemia. However, AML CFCs and CD34(+)CD38(-) AML blasts (enriched for candidate leukemia stem cells) from the same patient showed similar sensitivity to the liposomal or free drug formulations. In contrast, CFCs and CD34(+)CD38(-) cells from normal PB and BM were fivefold more sensitive to the free drugs than to CPX-351. Consistent with these observations, preferential intracellular accumulation of CPX-351 in AML over normal cells was observed, while there was little difference in drug uptake between AML and normal cells with the free drug cocktail. ### conclusions CPX-351, as compared to free cytarabine:daunorubicin, shows enhanced selective in vitro cytotoxicity for AML rather than normal progenitors."}

A single dose of primaquine, which is inexpensive and effective against mature gametocytes, could be added to further reduce the potential for posttreatment parasite transmission. Currently, we have few data regarding the effectiveness or safety of doing so. We collected data from 21 therapeutic efficacy trials of the National Antimalarial Drug Resistance Monitoring System of India conducted during 2009 to 2010, wherein 9 sites used single-dose primaquine (0.75 mg/kg of body weight) administered on day 2 along with artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) while 12 did not. We estimated the effect of primaquine on posttreatment gametocyte clearance and the total number of gametocyte-weeks as determined by microscopy. We compared the median area under the curve for gametocyte density and reported adverse events. One thousand three hundred thirty-five patients completed the antimalarial drug treatment. Adjusting for region, primaquine increased the rate of gametocyte clearance (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 3.3), prevented 45% (95% CI, 19 to 62) of posttreatment gametocyte-weeks, and decreased the area under the gametocyte density curve over the 28-day follow-up compared to AS+SP alone (P value = 0.01). The results were robust to other adjustment sets, and the estimated effect of primaquine increased during sensitivity analysis on the measurement of exposure time. No serious adverse events were detected. In conclusion, the addition of primaquine to AS+SP was effective in reducing the posttreatment presence of P. falciparum gametocytes. Primaquine was well tolerated and could be administered along with an artemisinin combination therapy as the first-line therapy."}

Except for monophasic ethinyloestradiol plus levonorgestrel, the oestrogen-containing combinations increased serum triglyceride level. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remained stable with all treatments, but the cholesterol/triglyceride ratio of LDL decreased during all combinations with ethinyloestradiol. Levonorgestrel reduced total high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and both progestins reduced HDL2 cholesterol concentration. Addition of ethinyloestradiol reversed this change in the desogestrel but not in the levonorgestrel group. The polyphasic ethinyloestradiol plus levonorgestrel combination did not change total HDL cholesterol. Hepatic lipase was activated with either progestin when administered alone but its activity was suppressed below the baseline level when ethinyloestradiol was added. Conversely, both progestins suppressed sex hormone binding globulin levels, but addition of ethinyloestradiol caused marked increases above baseline. These increases were greater in women taking desogestrel than in those taking levonorgestrel. No treatment affected lipoprotein lipase activity significantly. ### conclusions Monophasic or polyphasic combinations of ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel do not have deleterious effects on serum lipoproteins. If levonorgestrel is used as the progestin component, polyphasic ethinyloestradiol plus levonorgestrel appears more favourable than monophasic ethinyloestradiol plus levonorgestrel."}

Significantly (p < 0.05) more patients preferred dorzolamide (n = 9) over brinzolamide (n = 2), whereas nine patients gave a neutral answer. ### conclusion Dorzolamide bid or tid and brinzolamide bid when combined with latanoprost therapy elicited significant IOP reduction for 24 hours. It is rational to consider patients' preference of therapeutic regimen especially long-term users such as those with glaucoma."}

Similarly, in the Sprague-Dawley rats, the expression of BK-2Rs was increased at 12 h (1.8-fold, P < 0.05) and at 3 days (3.1-fold, P < 0.05) after aortic banding, and at 2 weeks (2.2-fold) after angiotensin II infusion. In the 12-month-old SHRs, with compensated left ventricular hypertrophy (no fibrosis or left ventricular dysfunction), the amount of BK-2Rs was also significantly increased (1.8-fold, P < 0.05). However, in the 20-month-old SHRs, with a dramatic increase in fibrosis and development of diastolic dysfunction and heart failure, the amount of BK-2Rs were significantly decreased (63%, P < 0.05) specifically in the cardiac endothelial cells. ### conclusions The present results show that, during pressure overload and compensated left ventricular hypertrophy, the expression of BK-2Rs is increased. However, ongoing pressure overload leads to a loss of BK-2Rs with a dramatic increase in left ventricular fibrosis followed by diastolic dysfunction and heart failure."}

We hypothesised that trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer could be mediated by immune mechanisms. We assessed the safety and anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, added to trastuzumab in trastuzumab-resistant, advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. ### methods We did this single-arm, multicentre, phase 1b-2 trial in 11 centres based in five countries. Eligible participants were women aged 18 years or older, who had advanced, histologically confirmed, HER2-positive breast cancer; documented progression during previous trastuzumab-based therapy; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded metastatic tumour biopsy for central assessment of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. In phase 1b, we enrolled patients with PD-L1-positive tumours in a 3\u2008+\u20083 dose-escalation of intravenous pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) plus 6 mg/kg of intravenous trastuzumab. The primary endpoint of the phase 1b study was the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity and recommended phase 2 dose; however, a protocol amendment on Aug 28, 2015, stipulated a flat dose of pembrolizumab of 200 mg every 3 weeks in all Merck-sponsored trials. In phase 2, patients with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumours were enrolled in parallel cohorts and received the flat dose of pembrolizumab plus standard trastuzumab. The primary endpoint of the phase 2 study was the proportion of PD-L1-positive patients achieving an objective response. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02129556, and with EudraCT, number 2013-004770-10, and is closed. ### findings Between Feb 2, 2015, and April 5, 2017, six patients were enrolled in phase 1b (n=3 received 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab, n=3 received 10 mg/kg pembrolizumab) and 52 patients in phase 2 (n=40 had PD-L1-positive tumours, n=12 had PD-L1-negative tumours). The data cutoff for this analysis was Aug 7, 2017. During phase 1b, there were no dose-limiting toxicities in the dose cohorts tested. Median follow-up for the phase 2 cohort was 13\u00b76 months (IQR 11\u00b76-18\u00b74) for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, and 12\u00b72 months (7\u00b79-12\u00b72) for patients with PD-L1-negative tumours. Six (15%, 90% CI 7-29) of 40 PD-L1-positive patients achieved an objective response. There were no objective responders among the PD-L1-negative patients. The most common treatment-related adverse event of any grade was fatigue (12 [21%] of 58 patients). Grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 29 (50%) of patients, treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 17 (29%), and serious adverse events occurred in 29 (50%) patients. The most commonly occurring serious adverse events were dyspnoea (n=3 [5%]), pneumonitis (n=3 [5%]), pericardial effusion (n=2 [3%]), and upper respiratory infection (n=2 [3%]). There was one treatment-related death due to Lambert-Eaton syndrome in a PD-L1-negative patient during phase 2. ### interpretation Pembrolizumab plus trastuzumab was safe and showed activity and durable clinical benefit in patients with PD-L1-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, advanced, HER2-positive breast cancer. Further studies in this breast cancer subtype should focus on a PD-L1-positive population and be done in less heavily pretreated patients. ### funding Merck, International Breast Cancer Study Group."}

The effect of antibiotic treatment on bacterial adherence was tested by the perfusion of individual antibiotics into separate modified Robbins devices using a side-arm adaptor and the results were compared with saline controls. ### results Compared with the saline controls, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime caused a 10- to 100-fold reduction in the number of E coli attached to the stents, whereas ampicillin had no effect on adherence of E coli. Ampicillin caused a 5- to 10-fold reduction in Enterococcus adherence but there was no change with ceftazidime. Sustained reduction in E coli adherence was observed with prolonged ciprofloxacin perfusion. ### conclusion Timely treatment with appropriate antibiotics reduced bacterial adherence in vitro and may be potentially beneficial in the prevention of stent blockage."}

Therapy consisted of bendamustine (70 mg/m(2)) for 2 consecutive days every 28 days, and ofatumumab 300 mg on day 1 and 1000 mg on day 8 during the first cycle, and 1000 mg on day 1 subsequently. Treatment was administered up to six cycles. The overall response rate (ORR), as per intention-to-treat analysis, was 72.3% (95% confidence of interval (CI), 57-84%), with 17% complete responses. After a median follow-up of 24.2 months, the overall survival was 83.6% (95% CI, 73.0-95.7%) and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 49.6% (95% CI, 35.9-68.6%). The median PFS was 23.6 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify clinical and biological characteristics associated with ORR and PFS. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity; grade \u22653 neutropenia was observed in 61.7% of patients; however, grade \u22653 infections occurred in 6% of patients.

One promising target in this context may be interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine known to play an important role in inflammation and adaptive immunity. ### methods This investigator-driven RCT was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of clazakizumab, a genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6. The study will include 20 DSA-positive kidney allograft recipients diagnosed with ABMR \u2265\u2009365\u2009days after transplantation. Participants will be recruited at two study sites in Austria and Germany (Medical University of Vienna; Charit\u00e9 University Medicine Berlin). First, patients will enter a three-month double-blind RCT (1,1 randomization, stratification according to ABMR phenotype and study site) and will receive either clazakizumab (subcutaneous administration of 25\u2009mg in monthly intervals) or placebo. In a second open-label part of the trial (months 4-12), all patients will receive clazakizumab at 25\u2009mg every month. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clazakizumab, its effect on drug metabolism in the liver, DSA characteristics, morphological ABMR lesions and molecular gene expression patterns in three- and 12-month protocol biopsies, serum/urinary biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation/injury, Torque Teno viral load as a measure of overall immunosuppression, kidney function, urinary protein excretion, as well as transplant and patient survival. ### discussion Currently, there is no treatment proven to be effective in halting the progression of late ABMR. Based on the hypothesis that antagonizing the effects of IL-6 improves the outcome of DSA-positive late ABMR by counteracting DSA-triggered inflammation and B cell/plasma cell-driven alloimmunity, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide proof of concept of a novel treatment of this type of rejection. ### Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03444103 .

In each group, 5-8 animals received triple drug treatment of methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg), azathioprine (2 mg/kg), and cyclosporine (5 mg/kg) daily, 5-10 animals were left without treatment, and 6 syngenic transplantations were performed. The grafts were monitored with ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsies to quantify the inflammation in the graft. Graft histology was performed in parallel and quantified by using the chronic allograft damage index (CADI). ### results In nonimmunosuppressed animals, irreversible acute rejection with a high peak of inflammation appeared in every strain combination within 5-8 days. In triple drug-treated rats, the DA-->AO combination demonstrated a prolonged acute rejection but no characteristic chronic changes, and the PVG-->BN combination showed practically no inflammation and did not develop any signs of chronic rejection within 60 days (CADI: 2.7+/-2.1), but the DA-->BN combination showed an early, mild inflammatory response 5-7 days after transplantation and developed chronic rejection within 40-60 days after transplantation (CADI: 7.9+/-3.1). Syngenic animals showed no inflammation or histological alterations (CADI: 1.7+/-2.0). ### conclusions In conclusion, in the DA-->BN combination with triple drug treatment, early mild inflammation was followed by the development of chronic rejection and can be used as an experimental model that resembles the clinical situation in renal transplantation."}

Simultaneous administration of voriconazole and amphotericin B resulted in fungicidal activity, whereas only fungistatic activity was observed when repeated doses of amphotericin B were administered sequentially after voriconazole at 24-96 h. The inhibition of the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B was voriconazole dose-dependent, but seemed to be recovered once the voriconazole concentration fell below the MIC.

We aimed to clarify the effects of aspirin/cilostazol therapy on the platelet and endothelial functions of patients with acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, in comparison to patients who were treated with aspirin alone. Methods The present randomized prospective pilot study enrolled 24 patients within a week after the onset of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (100 mg/day) (A group; 11 patients) or cilostazol (200 mg/day) plus aspirin (100 mg/day) (CA group; 13 patients). We measured platelet aggregation, platelet activation, and the thrombomodulin (TM), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and von Willebrand (vWF) antigen levels and vWF activity over a 4-week period after enrollment. Results There was no significant difference in the platelet functions of the A and CA groups. However, the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was decreased at 2 and 4 weeks (p<0.05) after treatment in comparison to the pre-treatment values in the CA group, but not in the A group. Platelet activation, and the hs-CRP, TM, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and vWF values did not significantly decrease after treatment in either group. Conclusion Although there were no significant differences in platelet aggregation, platelet activation or the endothelial biomarker levels of the A and CA groups, dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol inhibited platelet aggregation in comparison to the pre-treatment values, similarly to patients who received aspirin alone. This may suggest the clinical usefulness of dual therapy with aspirin and cilostazol in the treatment of patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke."}

Given the results of the TEAM trial, upfront use of tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor (AI) may be an important option for adjuvant endocrine therapy in Japanese postmenopausal women."}

The LEAD programme included six randomised clinical trials with 3967 participants analysing efficacy and safety of liraglutide 1.2 mg (LEAD 1-6 trials), rosiglitazone (LEAD 1 trial), glimepiride (LEAD 2-3 trials), insulin glargine (LEAD 5 trial), and exenatide (LEAD 6 trial). The WTP survey used discrete choice experimental (DCE) methodology to evaluate the convenience and clinical effects of glucose lowering treatments. ### results People with type 2 diabetes were prepared to pay an extra \u20ac2.64/day for liraglutide compared with rosiglitazone, an extra \u20ac1.94/day compared with glimepiride, an extra \u20ac3.36/day compared with insulin glargine, and an extra \u20ac0.81/day compared with exenatide.

Differences in the administration of the two drugs was the largest component of WTP for liraglutide (once daily anytime) compared with exenatide (twice daily with meals). A limitation of the study was that it was based on six clinical trials where liraglutide was the test drug, but each trial had a different comparator, therefore the clinical effects of liraglutide were much better documented than the comparators. ### conclusions WTP analyses of the clinical results from the LEAD programme suggested that participants with type 2 diabetes were willing to pay appreciably more for liraglutide than other glucose lowering treatments. This was driven by the relative advantage of weight loss compared with rosiglitazone, glimepiride, and insulin glargine, and administration frequency compared with exenatide."}

We conducted a phase II single-arm trial to assess the efficacy and safety of PCT based on PLD followed by paclitaxel (PTX) in a HRBC population usually undertreated. Fifty patients with stage II-IIIB breast cancer and at least one risk factor for developing cardiotoxicity initiated PLD 35\u00a0mg/m(2) plus cyclophosphamide 600\u00a0mg/m(2) every 4\u00a0weeks for four cycles, followed by 80\u00a0mg/m(2) weekly PTX for 12.

Eighty-four per cent of patients were older than 65\u00a0years, 64\u00a0% suffered from hypertension, and 10\u00a0% had prior cardiac disease. In an intention-to-treat analysis, breast pCR was 32\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 19.5-46.7\u00a0%) and pCR in breast and axilla was 24\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 12.1-35.8\u00a0%).

Products containing ephedrine as the single active medicinal ingredient: regulated August 1995. Pseudoephedrine products: regulated October 1997. Large-scale producers used ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in these forms. Ephedrine combined with other active medicinal ingredients (e.g. various cold medicines)-used mainly by small-scale producers: regulated October 1996. ### findings The regulation targeting small-scale producers (1996) had no significant impact. In contrast, methamphetamine arrests stopped rising and dropped 31% to 45% each of the three times precursor chemicals used by large-scale producers were regulated. Within 3 years of the bulk powder regulation (1989) and again within 2 years of the ephedrine single ingredient regulation (1995), arrests fully rebounded.

Additional IOP reduction was greater with carteolol than with nipradilol (cross-over analysis of variance; P = 0.0005). ### conclusions Both nipradilol and carteolol have additive effects when used in combination with latanoprost. Carteolol, however, may have a more potent effect than nipradilol."}

Given the action of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in targeting tumors with deficiencies in this repair pathway by loss of BRCA1/2, ovarian tumors could be an attractive population for clinical application of this therapy. PARP inhibitors have moved into clinical practice in the past few years, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) within the past 2 years. The U.S. FDA approval of olaparib applies to fourth line treatment in germline BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer, and European EMA approval to olaparib maintenance in both germline and somatic BRCA-mutant platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In order to widen the ovarian cancer patient population that would benefit from PARP inhibitors, predictive biomarkers based on a clear understanding of the mechanism of action are required. Additionally, a better understanding of the toxicity profile is needed if PARP inhibitors are to be used in the curative, rather than the palliative, setting. We reviewed the development of PARP inhibitors in phase I-III clinical trials, including combination trials of PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy/antiangiogenics, the approval for these agents, the mechanisms of resistance, and the outstanding issues, including the development of biomarkers and the rate of long-term hematologic toxicities with these agents. ### Implications For Practice The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), with a second agent (rucaparib) likely to be approved in the near future.

The purpose of the present study was to confirm this interaction in vitro. ### methods A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to assay 4-chlorophenylbiguanide (4-CPBG) and cycloguanil formed from proguanil by microsomes prepared from human liver. The limit of detection was 0.08 nmol mg-'. h-I. ### results The formation of 4-CPBG and cycloguanil could be described by one-enzyme kinetics, indicating that the formation of the two metabolites is almost exclusively catalysed by a single enzyme, i.e. CYP2C19 within the concentration range used, or that the contribution of an alternative low-affinity enzyme, probably CYP3A4, is very low. This notion was confirmed by the lack of potent inhibition by four CYP3A4 inhibitors: ketoconazole, bromocriptine, midazolam and dihydroergotamine. Fluvoxamine was a very effective inhibitor of the oxidation of proguanil, displaying Ki values of 0.69 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of cycloguanil formation and 4.7 micromol x l(-1) for the inhibition of 4-CPBG formation. As expected, the CYP2C19 substrate omeprazole inhibited the formation of both metabolites with an IC50 of 10 micromol x l(-1). Norfluoxetine and sulfaphenazole inhibited proguanil oxidation with Ki values of 7.3-16 micromol x l(-1), suggesting that the two compounds are moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19. ### conclusions Fluvoxamine is a fairly potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and it has the potential for causing drug-drug interactions with substrates for CYP2C19 such as imipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline and diazepam. The combination of fluvoxamine and proguanil can not be recommended."}

These agents were investigated in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first-line setting. ### methods The systematic review was executed on January 27, 2015, and updated on August 21, 2016, using a pre-specified search strategy. Searches were conducted using PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE, with supplemental searches using the Evidence Based Medicine Reviews and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs published in English from 1995-2016 and reporting at least one of the primary outcomes [overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, or quality of life] in patients who received first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale and Cochrane risk of bias tool, respectively. A Baysian network meta-analysis was performed on the primary outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) were evaluated for the primary analysis; secondary analyses were conducted using median OS data. Planned sensitivity analyses were conducted including reanalysis using a Frequentist approach and limiting analyses to subsets based on clinical and demographic covariates. ### results The systematic literature review resulted in identification of 4,016 unique publications; 40 publications (35 unique trials) were eligible for inclusion.

In most cases polytherapy is necessary. Tramadol and antidepressants have common mechanisms of action and are frequently used together in clinical practice, thus interaction between them is very important. In the present study isobolographic analysis for equivalent doses of drugs was applied to examine the nature of interaction between tramadol and doxepin or venlafaxine in a neuropathic pain model in rats. Allodynia and hyperalgesia were assessed after intraperitoneal administration of each drug alone or in combination. Dose response curves were obtained and ED(50) doses were calculated. All drugs were effective in reducing thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, however doxepin was more effective than venlafaxine. Combined administration of tramadol and doxepin demonstrated synergistic action in reducing thermal hyperalgesia and additive action in reducing mechanical allodynia. Combined administration of tramadol and venlafaxine showed additive action in reducing hyperalgesia and allodynia. Moreover, combined administration of tramadol and doxepin was more effective than combined administration of tramadol and venlafaxine. The experiments demonstrated that the nature of interaction between tramadol and doxepin is synergistic, which is not the case for tramadol and venlafaxine, what provides a valuable information referring to clinical practice, rationalizing administration of such drug combination."}

Patients with CS suffer from a variety of comorbidities that increase the risk of mortality. Surgical resection of the disease-causing lesion is generally the first-line treatment of CS. However, some patients may not be eligible for surgery due to comorbidities, and approximately 25\u00a0% of patients, especially those with CD, have recurrent disease. For these patients, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors may control cortisol elevation and subsequent symptomatology. CS is rare overall, and clinical studies of adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors are often small and, in many cases, data are limited regarding the efficacy and safety of these treatments. Our aim was to better characterize the profiles of efficacy and safety of currently available adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, including drugs currently in development. ### methods We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, focusing on novel drugs. ### results Currently available adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, including ketoconazole, metyrapone, etomidate, and mitotane, have variable efficacy and significant side effects, and none are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CS.

When seven intermediate signal durations, to which responses were not reinforced, were randomly interspersed the probability of a right-lever ('long') response increased as a function of signal duration. Methamphetamine shifted this psychometric function leftward and decreased its slope: haloperidol also decreased the slope but shifted the function rightward. A combination of haloperidol and methamphetamine led to a function similar to the saline control function. The leftward shift probably reflects an increase in the speed of an internal clock, and the rightward shift probably reflects a decrease in its speed. Since methamphetamine releases several catecholamines, including dopamine, and haloperidol blocks dopamine receptors, it is plausible that the horizontal location of the psychometric function (the speed of the clock) is related to the effective level of dopamine."}

Combination regimens have not been previously assessed in randomized studies. ### Patients And Methods The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance) 50401 trial is a randomized phase II trial studying rituximab (375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 weeks), lenalidomide (15 mg per day on days 1 to 21, followed by 7 days of rest, in cycle 1 and then 20 mg per day on days 1 to 21, followed by 7 days of rest, in cycles 2 to 12), or LR. The rituximab-alone arm was discontinued as a result of poor accrual. Eligibility included recurrent FL and prior rituximab with time to progression of \u2265 6 months from last dose. Aspirin or heparin was recommended for patients at high thrombosis risk. ### results Ninety-one patients (lenalidomide, n = 45; LR, n = 46) received treatment; median age was 63 years (range, 34 to 89 years), and 58% were intermediate or high risk according to the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. In the lenalidomide and LR arms, grade 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 58% and 53% of patients, with 9% and 11% of patients experiencing grade 4 toxicity, respectively; grade 3 to 4 adverse events included neutropenia (16% v 20%, respectively), fatigue (9% v 13%, respectively), and thrombosis (16% [n = 7] v 4% [n = 2], respectively; P = .157). Thirty-six percent of lenalidomide patients and 63% of LR patients completed 12 cycles. Lenalidomide alone was associated with more treatment failures, with 22% of patients discontinuing treatment as a result of adverse events. Dose-intensity exceeded 80% in both arms. Overall response rate was 53% (20% complete response) and 76% (39% complete response) for lenalidomide alone and LR, respectively (P = .029). At the median follow-up of 2.5 years, median time to progression was 1.1 year for lenalidomide alone and 2 years for LR (P = .0023). ### conclusion LR is more active than lenalidomide alone in recurrent FL with similar toxicity, warranting further study in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as a platform for addition of novel agents."}

In the present investigation, through tissue microarray analysis, we report higher levels of folate receptor expression in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue derived from patients, which were minimal in normal tissue. For folate-receptor based targeted therapy of PCa, we generated novel planetary ball milled (PBM) nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with resveratrol (RES), and in combination with docetaxel (DTX) and conjugated with folic acid (FA) on the surface. The cytotoxic effect of FA-conjugated DTX-nanoparticles was found effectual that reduced the concentration of free drug (DTX) to 28 times. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells by 30.92% and 65.9% in the FA-conjugated RES and in combination with DTX nanoparticle formulation respectively. However, only 8.9% apoptotic cells were found with control (empty NP). The expressions of NF-kB p65, COX-2, pro (BAX, BAK) and anti-apoptotic (BCL-2, BCL-XL) genes were significantly reduced after treatment with FA-RES\u00a0+\u00a0DTX-NP. In addition, the FA-conjugated DTX formulation exhibited additional cytotoxic effects with the down-regulation of survivin and an increased expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 in PCa cells. Further, we observed that treating DTX resistant PCa cells with FA-RES\u00a0+\u00a0DTX-NP exhibited a reversal of the ABC-transporter markers thereby limiting the multidrug resistance phenotype of the cancer cells. Our results strongly suggested that FA conjugated nanoparticle drugs acted as effective inhibitors of drug efflux that effectually enhances the intracellular concentration of the drug to exhibit their cytotoxic effect."}

In this follow-up study, patients with disease progression following initial clinical benefit-ie, a partial repsonse or stable disease-were eligible for retreatment and with the same doses and schedules for tremelimumab and durvalumab as used in the NIBIT-MESO-1 trial. The primary endpoint, immune-related objective response rate, was evaluated per immune-related modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or immune-related RECIST 1.1 criteria for patients with pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma, respectively. Key secondary endpoints were overall survival and safety, and TMB was also evaluated post hoc in patients who had tumour tissue available before treatment. The intention-to-treat population was used for analysis of all efficacy endpoints. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02588131. ### findings 40 patients were enrolled in the NIBIT-MESO-1 study between Oct 30, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016. At data cut-off, April 30, 2020, five (13%) of 40 patients were alive, and 35 (88%) patients had died of progressive disease. At a median follow-up of 52 months (IQR 49-53), median overall survival was 16\u00b75 months (95% CI 13\u00b77-19\u00b72). Survival was 20% (eight of 40 patients) at 36 months and 15% (six of 40 patients) and 48 months. 17 (43%) of 40 patients met the criteria for enrolment in the retreatment study and were retreated with at least one dose of tremelimumab and durvalumab. No immune-related objective responses were observed in the 17 retreated patients. Seven (41%) of 17 patients achieved immune-related stable disease. From the start of retreatment to a median follow-up of 24 months (22\u00b70-25\u00b70), median overall survival was 12\u00b75 months (95% CI 0\u00b70-25\u00b78), and survival at 12 months was 52\u00b79%, at 18 months was 35\u00b73%, and at 24 months was 23\u00b75%. There were no grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events in the retreatment cohort. In a post-hoc analysis of 28 patients for whom tumour tissue before treatment was available, patients with a TMB higher than the median value of 8\u00b73 mutations per Mb had a higher median overall survival compared with patients with TMB below the median value, but this difference was non-significant. Moreover, when patients were additionally stratified for ICI retreatment (n=13), there was a significant difference in survival between those with a TMB higher than the median of 8\u00b73 mutations per Mb and those with TMB lower than the median in the retreated cohort (41\u00b73 months vs 17\u00b74 months; p=0\u00b702). ### interpretation Tremelimumab combined with durvalumab was associated with long-term survival in patients with mesothelioma. Retreatment was safe and resulted in clinically meaningful outcomes, thus suggesting its potential application in the clinical practice of mesothalioma patients. ### funding NIBIT Foundation, Fondazione AIRC, AstraZeneca."}

With a median follow-up of 14 months, a maximum follow-up of 19.5 months, and an expected median survival of 5-6 years on the IFN-alpha/cytarabine control arm, few of the expected progressions to accelerated or blast phase or deaths have occurred.

Only 57% of the IFN-alpha target dose was administered, and only 68% of patients received any cytarabine.

Seven groups of recipient mice (n=10-28) received various combinations of the following treatment protocols: sirolimus, 1.5 mg/kg (3.0 mg/kg for xenografts) every other day from day 0 to day 12; cyclosporine, 50 mg/kg every other day from day 10 through 22; ALS, 0.5 ml on days -1 and 2 for allografts and days -1, 2, and 4 for xenografts; and BM, 25 million donor-specific cells IV on day 7. ### results The administration of ALS or ALS/BM resulted in modest but significant prolongation of skin graft survival in all combinations tested. Cyclosporine combined with ALS or ALS/BM significantly extended allograft survival compared with ALS or ALS/BM alone (P<0.05) but had no effect on xenograft survival. In contrast, the combination of sirolimus with ALS or ALS/BM resulted in a two- to threefold increase in allograft survival and over a fourfold increase in xenograft survival when compared with the comparable cyclosporine-based regimen.

Thus the tension-suppressant effect of diltiazem in human myocardium appears to be mediated by a combination of voltage-dependent block of the Ca2+ channel and inhibition of Ca2+ release from internal stores, and not from alterations in either Na+-Ca2+ coupled transport or Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments.", "abstract": "A comparative study of human atrial fibers (HAF), human ventricular fibers (HVF), frog ventricle, and frog skeletal muscle demonstrated marked differences in tension development in the presence of diltiazem. There was no significant difference between the tension developed by HAF and by HVF over a range of diltiazem concentrations when the differences in resting membrane potential were corrected by increasing external K+ concentration. In human myocardium, diltiazem resulted in both a voltage and use-dependent blockade of the calcium channel. Comparison of the tension-dose response curves in human myocardium, frog ventricle and skeletal muscle showed that diltiazem was most effective at decreasing tension in frog heart, and least effective in skeletal muscle with human myocardium being intermediate. In skeletal muscle, neither tension development nor the birefringence signal related to the Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was significantly altered by Diltiazem in concentrations less than 10(-6) M, but in concentrations greater than 10(-5) M both were suppressed.

Twenty-one genes were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and the RS was calculated. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the value of adding RS to a model with clinical variables (age, tumor size, grade, and treatment) in node-negative (N0) and node-positive (N+) women. RESULTS Reportable scores were available from 1,231 evaluable patients (N0, n = 872; N+, n = 306; and node status unknown, n = 53); 72, 74, and six DRs occurred in N0, N+, and node status unknown patients, respectively. For both N0 and N+ patients, RS was significantly associated with time to DR in multivariate analyses (P < .001 for N0 and P = .002 for N+). RS also showed significant prognostic value beyond that provided by Adjuvant! Online (P < .001).

Biologics are usually combined with traditional DMARDs, primarily methotrexate (MTX), but some biologics and tofacitinib (together referred to in this article as novel DMARDs) have been shown to be efficacious as monotherapy as well. In real-world practice, approximately one-third of RA patients receiving biologics are on monotherapy, primarily because of intolerance of, or noncompliance with, MTX. Limited data, however, are available analyzing the effectiveness of monotherapy compared with combination therapy across novel DMARDs. ### objective To compare American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses to approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) at 24 weeks in RA patients who have shown inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (DMARD-IR). ### methods Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified randomized controlled trials that assessed approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX in DMARD-IR RA patients. Twenty-eight RCTs were identified that evaluated abatacept, anakinra, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. ACR responses at 24 weeks were extracted and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analyses. ### results With the exception of anakinra plus MTX, which was less efficacious, most novel DMARDs, when used in combination with MTX, demonstrated comparable ACR responses. When novel DMARDs were used as monotherapies, greater ACR20/50/70 responses were observed with tocilizumab than with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (aTNF) or tofacitinib.

Relative efficacy estimates for the indirect comparison of tofacitinib plus MTX with tofacitinib monotherapy were very uncertain. ### conclusions Results suggest that in combination with MTX most of the available novel DMARDs have similar levels of efficacy in DMARD-IR patients. As monotherapy, however, tocilizumab displayed higher ACR responses than aTNF or tofacitinib. ACR responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab as monotherapy, whereas aTNF in combination with MTX demonstrated greater ACR responses than aTNF as monotherapy."}

In the ephedrine and phenylephrine experiments, the rate of infusion was adjusted to maintain maternal mean arterial pressure close to baseline. ### results Ritodrine infusion alone significantly increased maternal heart rate and cardiac output in all three groups. Epidural anesthesia during ritodrine infusion significantly decreased maternal mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, uterine blood flow, and fetal arterial oxygen tension for each of the three groups. Both ephedrine and phenylephrine restored maternal mean arterial pressure to baseline, as designed. Ephedrine significantly increased uterine blood flow and fetal arterial oxygen tension when compared with normal saline--control, but phenylephrine did not. Phenylephrine significantly increased uterine vascular resistance when compared with normal saline--control, but ephedrine did not. ### conclusions Although ephedrine and phenylephrine provided similar restoration of maternal mean arterial pressure, ephedrine was superior to phenylephrine in restoring uterine blood flow during ritodrine infusion and epidural anesthesia-induced hypotension in gravid ewes. Also, ephedrine, but not phenylephrine, significantly improved fetal oxygenation, when compared to normal saline--control."}

The thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (TBF) protocol has recently demonstrated promising outcome in cord blood and haploidentical SCT; however, there is limited evidence about this regimen in transplant from matched siblings (MSD) and unrelated donors (UD). We retrospectively compared outcomes of 2523 patients aged 18-50 with AML in remission, undergoing transplant from MSD or UD prepared with either TBF or BuCy conditioning. A 1:3 pair-matched analysis was performed: 146 patients receiving TBF were compared with 438 patients receiving BuCy. Relapse risk was significantly lower in the TBF when compared with BuCy group (HR 0.6, P\u2009=\u2009.02), while NRM did not differ. No significant difference was observed in LFS and OS between the two regimens. TBF was associated with a trend towards higher risk of grades III-IV aGVHD (HR 1.8, P\u2009=\u2009.06) and inferior cGVHD (HR 0.7, P\u2009=\u2009.04) when compared with BuCy. In patients undergoing transplant in first remission, the advantage for TBF in terms of relapse was more evident (HR 0.4, P\u2009=\u2009.02), leading to a trend for better LFS in favor of TBF (HR 0.7, P\u2009=\u2009.10), while OS did not differ between the two cohorts. In conclusion, TBF represents a valid myeloablative conditioning regimen providing significantly lower relapse and similar survival when compared with BuCy. Patients in first remission appear to gain the most from this protocol, as in this subgroup a tendency for better LFS was observed when compared with BuCy."}

In the NSABP B-42 study, we aimed to determine whether extended letrozole treatment improves disease-free survival after 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy in women with postmenopausal breast cancer. ### methods This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done in 158 centres in the USA, Canada, and Ireland. Postmenopausal women with stage I-IIIA hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, who were disease-free after about 5 years of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 5 years of letrozole (2\u00b75 mg orally per day) or placebo.

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00382070, is active, and is no longer enrolling patients. ### findings Between Sept 28, 2006, and Jan 6, 2010, 3966 patients were randomly assigned to receive letrozole (n=1983) or placebo (n=1983). Follow-up information was available for 3903 patients for the analyses of disease-free survival. Median follow-up was 6\u00b79 years (IQR 6\u00b71-7\u00b75). Letrozole treatment did not significantly improve disease-free survival (339 disease-free survival events were reported in the placebo group and 292 disease-free survival events were reported in the letrozole group; hazard ratio 0\u00b785, 95% CI 0\u00b773-0\u00b7999; p=0\u00b7048). 7-year disease-free survival estimate was 81\u00b73% (95% CI 79\u00b73-83\u00b71) in the placebo group and 84\u00b77% (82\u00b79-86\u00b74) in the letrozole group. The most common grade 3 adverse events were arthralgia (47 [2%] of 1933 patients in the placebo group vs 50 [3%] of 1941 patients in the letrozole group) and back pain (44 [2%] vs 38 [2%]). The most common grade 4 adverse event in the placebo group was thromboembolic event (eight [<1%]) and the most common grade 4 adverse events in the letrozole group were urinary tract infection, hypokalaemia, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (four [<1%] each). ### interpretation After 5 years of aromatase inhibitor-based therapy, 5 years of letrozole therapy did not significantly prolong disease-free survival compared with placebo. Careful assessment of potential risks and benefits is required before recommending extended letrozole therapy to patients with early-stage breast cancer. ### funding National Cancer Institute, Korea Health Technology R&D Project, Novartis."}

Changes in cyclin E2 or D1 were not correlated with sorafenib sensitivity. The knockdown of cyclin E1 expression reversed the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib in terms of cell growth and apoptosis induction, whereas the overexpression of cyclin E1 increased the resistance to sorafenib. The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects of sorafenib were enhanced by flavopiridol, and Mcl-1 suppression was determined to play a critical role in mediating this enhancing effect. ### conclusions The cyclin E1 suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells may serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for predicting sorafenib efficacy.

SCN presented superior effects over sorafenib, curcumin, and their physical mixture (Sora + Cur) on enhancing in vitro cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis in BEL-7402 cells and Hep G2 cells, and antiangiogenesis activities in tube formation and microvessel formation from aortic rings. Moreover, the tissue concentration of sorafenib and curcumin in gastrointestinal tract and major organs were significantly improved after their coassembly into SCN. In particular, in BEL-7402 cells induced tumor xenograft, SCN treatment displayed the obviously enhanced inhibitory effect on tumor progression over free drug monotherapy or their physical mixture, with significantly increased antiproliferation and antiangiogenesis capability. Thereby, the codelivered nanoassemblies of sorafenib and curcumin provided a promising strategy to enhance the combinational therapy of HCC."}

In addition, we examined the multipotent CD25(+)CML cell line KU812. ### results In contrast to normal hematopoietic stem cells, CD34(+)/CD38(-)CML LSCs expressed the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, IL-2RA (CD25). STAT5 was found to induce expression of CD25 in Lin(-)/Sca-1(+)/Kit(+)stem cells in C57Bl/6 mice. Correspondingly, shRNA-induced STAT5 depletion resulted in decreased CD25 expression in KU812 cells. Moreover, the BCR/ABL1 inhibitors nilotinib and ponatinib were found to decrease STAT5 activity and CD25 expression in KU812 cells and primary CML LSCs. A CD25-targeting shRNA was found to augment proliferation of KU812 cellsin vitroand their engraftmentin vivoin NOD/SCID-IL-2R\u03b3(-/-)mice. In drug-screening experiments, the PI3K/mTOR blocker BEZ235 promoted the expression of STAT5 and CD25 in CML cells. Finally, we found that BEZ235 produces synergistic antineoplastic effects on CML cells when applied in combination with nilotinib or ponatinib. ### conclusions CD25 is a novel STAT5-dependent marker of CML LSCs and may be useful for LSC detection and LSC isolation in clinical practice and basic science. Moreover, CD25 serves as a growth regulator of CML LSCs, which may have biologic and clinical implications and may pave the way for the development of new more effective LSC-eradicating treatment strategies in CML."}

Prior treatment with SSAs and any systemic or locoregional therapy was allowed except for mTOR inhibitors. Patients continued treatment until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 months; secondary endpoints included early biochemical response, objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.0, overall survival (OS), AEs, activation of mTOR pathway (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor [IGF1R] and phosphoS6 [pS6] expression). ### results Forty-three patients were included in the intent-to-treat analyses. After 12 months of treatment, 62.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48%-77%) of patients had not progressed or died. The 24-month PFS rate was 43.6% (95% CI 29%-58%). The confirmed ORR was 2.3%, and stable disease was 58.1%. Median OS was not reached after 24 months of median follow-up. Dose reductions and temporary interruptions due to AEs were required in 14 (33%) and 33 (77%) patients, respectively. The most frequent AEs were diarrhea, asthenia, mucositis, rash, and hyperglycemia. No correlation was observed between IGFR1 and pS6 expression and PFS/OS. ### conclusion The everolimus-octreotide combination provided clinically relevant efficacy in nonfunctioning GI-NETs, similar to the results of RADIANT-2 in functioning setting. ### Implications For Practice The EVERLAR study reports prospective data of somatostatin analogue in combination with everolimus in nonfunctioning gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors suggesting meaningful activity and favorable toxicity profile that supports drug combination in this setting."}

Here we report final results of our study aiming to show non-inferior overall survival with first-line bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. ### methods In this multinational, open-label, randomised phase 3 TURANDOT trial, patients aged 18 years or older who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 and measurable or non-measurable HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had received no previous chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were stratified and randomly assigned (1:1) using permuted blocks of size six to either bevacizumab plus paclitaxel (bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 plus paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) or bevacizumab plus capecitabine (bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 every 3 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Stratification factors were oestrogen or progesterone receptor status, country, and menopausal status. The primary objective was to show non-inferior overall survival with bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel in the per-protocol population by rejecting the null hypothesis of inferiority (HR \u22651\u00b733) using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00600340. ### findings Between Sept 10, 2008, and Aug 30, 2010, 564 patients were randomised, representing the intent-to-treat population. The per-protocol population comprised 531 patients (266 in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group and 265 in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group). At the final overall survival analysis after 183 deaths (69%) in 266 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 201 (76%) in 265 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine in the per-protocol population, median overall survival was 30\u00b72 months (95% CI 25\u00b76-32\u00b76 months) versus 26\u00b71 months (22\u00b73-29\u00b70), respectively. The stratified HR was 1\u00b702 (97\u00b75% RCI -\u221e to 1\u00b726; repeated p=0\u00b70070), indicating non-inferiority. The unstratified Cox model (HR 1\u00b713 [97\u00b75% RCI -\u221e to 1\u00b739]; repeated p=0\u00b7061) did not support the primary analysis. Intent-to-treat analyses were consistent with the per-protocol results. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (54 [19%] of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group vs 5 [2%] of 277 patients in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group), hand-foot syndrome (1 [<1%] vs 43 [16%]), peripheral neuropathy (39 [14%] vs 1 [<1%]), leucopenia (20 [7%] vs 1 [<1%]), and hypertension (12 [4%] vs 16 [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 65 (23%) of 284 patients receiving bevacizumab plus paclitaxel and 68 (25%) of 277 receiving bevacizumab plus capecitabine. Deaths in two (1%) of 284 patients in the bevacizumab plus paclitaxel group were deemed by the investigator to be treatment-related. No treatment-related deaths occurred in the bevacizumab plus capecitabine group. ### interpretation Bevacizumab plus capecitabine represents a valid first-line treatment option for HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, offering good tolerability without compromising overall survival compared with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. Although progression-free survival with the bevacizumab plus capecitabine combination is inferior to that noted with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel, we suggest that physicians should consider possible predictive risk factors for overall survival, individual's treatment priorities, and the differing safety profiles. ### funding Roche."}

Final follow-up was August 2012. ### interventions Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n\u2009=\u2009248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n\u2009=\u2009248 participants). ### Main Outcomes And Measures The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%. ### results Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly. ### Conclusions And Relevance Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed. ### Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00729937."}

This could impair the first line triple therapy of the H.pylori infection. There is a need of conducting surveillance of H.pylori susceptibility pattern in Africa for dual and triple resistance which can be used for the empirical treatment."}

However, dexamethasone given in the absence of food had no effect on serum leptin at 10 hours. The present experiment was undertaken to determine the duration of the effect of dexamethasone on 24-hour serum leptin under fasted and fed conditions in humans. ### Research Methods And Procedures Six healthy non-obese male volunteers were studied under the following four conditions: 1) dexamethasone (2 mg intravenously, given at 0900 hours) with fasting; 2) dexamethasone with food (1,700 kcal, 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 30% fat, given in one meal 2 hours after dexamethasone administration at 1100 hours); 3) saline with food (same meal); 4) saline with fasting. Serum leptin, glucose, insulin, and cortisol were monitored every 30 minutes for 24 hours. ### results 1) Under the fasting condition, dexamethasone increased leptin nocturnal secretion between 2100 and 2400 hours. 2) A single meal (1,700 kcal) at 1100 hours increased nocturnal leptin secretion when compared with the fasting condition. The peak increase of leptin was 123% over baseline between 2100 and 2400 hours, 10 to 14 hours after the meal. 3) In the fed + dexamethasone condition, leptin levels increased from baseline starting 8 hours after dexamethasone injection, reached a maximum increase of 260% between 2100 and 2400 hours, then decreased thereafter, remaining elevated compared to baseline for 16 hours. There was a correlation between 24-hour leptin secretion and insulin secretion after a single morning meal. ### discussion A single bolus of dexamethasone, given before a single large meal, produces a delayed (6-hour) but long-lasting increase in serum leptin (over 16 hours).

In vitro, Aspirin synergized with Metformin in inducing apoptosis of triple negative and endocrine-sensitive BC cells, and in activating AMPK in BC and in white adipose tissue (WAT) progenitors known to cooperate to BC progression. Both Aspirin and Atenolol added to the inhibitory effect of Metformin against complex I of the respiratory chain. In both immune-deficient and immune-competent preclinical models, Atenolol increased Metformin activity against angiogenesis, local and metastatic growth of HER2+ and triple negative BC. Aspirin increased the activity of Metformin only in immune-competent HER2+ BC models. Both Aspirin and Atenolol, when added to Metformin, significantly reduced the endothelial cell component of tumor vessels, whereas pericytes were reduced by the addition of Atenolol but not by the addition of Aspirin. Our data indicate that the addition of Aspirin or of Atenolol to Metformin might be beneficial for BC control, and that this activity is likely due to effects on both BC and microenvironment cells."}

FP was defined as either a \u226550% increase in the sum of largest diameters (SLDs) within 6 weeks of treatment initiation or death due to cancer progression within 12 weeks (absent post-baseline scan). ### results Forty-two of 421 patients (10%) receiving atezolizumab and 37 of 402 (9%) receiving docetaxel had FP. Twenty patients with FP (48%) receiving atezolizumab versus 12 (30%) receiving docetaxel had a \u226550%\u2009SLD increase within 6 weeks. FP was significantly associated with an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 1 (vs 0), \u22653 metastatic sites at baseline, and failure of preceding first-line treatment within 6 months, but not with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 or tumor mutational burden. Overall survival in patients with FP and a \u226550%\u2009SLD increase at week 6 was similar with atezolizumab and docetaxel (unstratified HR 0.89 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.92)). ### conclusions FP rates were similar with atezolizumab and docetaxel in the OAK study, suggesting that FP may not be unique to checkpoint inhibitors, although the underlying mechanisms may differ from those of chemotherapy. Applying the FP criteria to other phase III checkpoint inhibitor trials may further elucidate the risk factors for FP. ### Trial Registration Number NCT02008227."}

The authors sought to increase the activity of vinblastine in RCC through the addition of estramustine. ### methods Twenty-one patients with metastatic RCC not previously treated with chemotherapy received oral estramustine phosphate, 600 mg/m(2), on Days 1, 2, and 3 weekly for 6 weeks, and intravenous vinblastine, 4 mg/m(2) on Day 2 weekly for 6 weeks, repeated every 8 weeks. Twenty-one patients received 31 cycles of therapy. ### results Two patients experienced Grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity, and three patients had Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity consisting of neurologic toxicity, hepatic toxicity, or angioneurotic edema. One patient had a partial response with decreased liver metastases for 48 weeks; 9 patients had stable disease, for a median duration of 14 weeks (range, 11-31 weeks); and 11 patients demonstrated disease progression. The median overall time to progression was 8 weeks and the median overall survival period was 24 weeks. ### conclusions Although well tolerated, the combination of oral estramustine phosphate with vinblastine administered on this schedule had minimal activity in patients with metastatic RCC."}

Evidence of low quality demonstrates that QoL is worse with IFN alone and that severe AEs are increased with IFN alone or in combination. There is low-quality evidence that IFN-\u03b1 alone increases mortality but moderate-quality evidence on decreased AEs compared to IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab. Low-quality evidence shows no difference for IFN-\u03b1 plus bevacizumab compared to sunitinib with respect to mortality and severe AEs. Low-quality evidence demonstrates no difference of vaccine treatment compared to standard targeted therapies in mortality and AEs, whereas there is moderate-quality evidence that targeted immunotherapies reduce mortality and AEs and improve QoL."}

Cytarabine was given on days 15 to 28 of each cycle at an initial dose of 20 mg/m2/d via subcutaneous injection. Adverse events were frequently observed with grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities and nonhematologic toxicities in 53% (n = 16) and 23% (n = 7) of patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence of complete cytogenetic response (CCR) at 12 months was 83% and at 6 months 100% of the patients achieved complete hematologic response (CHR). We concluded that the combination was safe and promising given the rates of response."}

Treatment consisted of oral capecitabine 650 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1 through 14 plus gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) as a 30-minute infusion on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks until progression. The primary end point was the number of patients categorized as having a CBR or stable CBR (SCBR) during the first three treatment cycles. ### results Forty-four patients were enrolled (bile duct cancer, n = 36; gallbladder cancers, n = 8). The main grade 3 or 4 adverse events included hematologic toxicity and fatigue. After three cycles, 36% of patients achieved a CBR, and 34% achieved an SCBR. Over the full course of treatment, 57% of patients achieved a CBR, and 18% achieved an SCBR. Improved QOL was observed in patients with a CBR or SCBR. The objective response rate was 25%. Median time to progression and overall survival times were 7.2 months and 13.2 months, respectively. ### conclusion Chemotherapy with GemCap is well tolerated and effective and leads to a high CBR rate. Patient-reported outcomes are useful for evaluating the effects of palliative chemotherapy in patients with biliary tract cancer."}

The date of the search was 21 February 2018. ### Selection Criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of intravitreal anti-VEGF combined with intravitreal steroids versus intravitreal anti-VEGF alone, intravitreal steroids alone or macular laser alone for managing DMO. We included people with DMO of all ages and both sexes. We also included trials where both eyes from one participant received different treatments. ### Data Collection And Analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.Two authors independently reviewed all the titles and abstracts identified from the electronic and manual searches against the inclusion criteria. Our primary outcome was change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between baseline and one year. Secondary outcomes included change in central macular thickness (CMT), economic data and quality of life. We considered adverse effects including intraocular inflammation, raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and development of cataract. ### Main Results There were eight RCTs (703 participants, 817 eyes) that met our inclusion criteria with only three studies reporting outcomes at one year. The studies took place in Iran (3), USA (2), Brazil (1), Czech Republic (1) and South Korea (1). Seven studies used the unlicensed anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab and one study used licensed ranibizumab. The study that used licensed ranibizumab had a unique design compared with the other studies in that included eyes had persisting DMO after anti-VEGF monotherapy and received three monthly doses of ranibizumab prior to allocation. The anti-VEGF agent was combined with intravitreal triamcinolone in six studies and with an intravitreal dexamethasone implant in two studies. The comparator group was anti-VEGF alone in all studies; two studies had an additional steroid monotherapy arm, another study had an additional macular laser photocoagulation arm. Whilst we judged these studies to be at low risk of bias for most domains, at least one domain was at unclear risk in all studies.When comparing anti-VEGF/steroid with anti-VEGF monotherapy as primary therapy for DMO, we found no meaningful clinical difference in change in BCVA (mean difference (MD) -2.29 visual acuity (VA) letters, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.03 to 1.45; 3 RCTs; 188 eyes; low-certainty evidence) or change in CMT (MD 0.20 \u03bcm, 95% CI -37.14 to 37.53; 3 RCTs; 188 eyes; low-certainty evidence) at one year. There was very low-certainty evidence on intraocular inflammation from 8 studies, with one event in the anti-VEGF/steroid group (313 eyes) and two events in the anti-VEGF group (322 eyes). There was a greater risk of raised IOP (Peto odds ratio (OR) 8.13, 95% CI 4.67 to 14.16; 635 eyes; 8 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) and development of cataract (Peto OR 7.49, 95% CI 2.87 to 19.60; 635 eyes; 8 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) in eyes receiving anti-VEGF/steroid compared with anti-VEGF monotherapy. There was low-certainty evidence from one study of an increased risk of systemic adverse events in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the anti-VEGF alone group (Peto OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.86; 103 eyes).One study compared anti-VEGF/steroid versus macular laser therapy. At one year investigators did not report a meaningful difference between the groups in change in BCVA (MD 4.00 VA letters 95% CI -2.70 to 10.70; 80 eyes; low-certainty evidence) or change in CMT (MD -16.00 \u03bcm, 95% CI -68.93 to 36.93; 80 eyes; low-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence suggesting an increased risk of cataract in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the macular laser group (Peto OR 4.58, 95% 0.99 to 21.10, 100 eyes) and an increased risk of elevated IOP in the anti-VEGF/steroid group compared with the macular laser group (Peto OR 9.49, 95% CI 2.86 to 31.51; 100 eyes).One study provided very low-certainty evidence comparing anti-VEGF/steroid versus steroid monotherapy at one year. There was no evidence of a meaningful difference in BCVA between treatments at one year (MD 0 VA letters, 95% CI -6.1 to 6.1, low-certainty evidence). Likewise, there was no meaningful difference in the mean CMT at one year (MD - 9 \u03bcm, 95% CI -39.87\u03bcm to 21.87\u03bcm between the anti-VEGF/steroid group and the steroid group. There was very low-certainty evidence on raised IOP at one year comparing the anti-VEGF/steroid versus steroid groups (Peto OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.55).No included study reported impact of treatment on patients' quality of life or economic data. None of the studies reported any cases of endophthalmitis. ### Authors Conclusions Combination of intravitreal anti-VEGF plus intravitreal steroids does not appear to offer additional visual benefit compared with monotherapy for DMO; at present the evidence for this is of low-certainty. There was an increased rate of cataract development and raised intraocular pressure in eyes treated with anti-VEGF plus steroid versus anti-VEGF alone. Patients were exposed to potential side effects of both these agents without reported additional benefit. The majority of the evidence comes from studies of bevacizumab and triamcinolone used as primary therapy for DMO. There is limited evidence from studies using licensed intravitreal anti-VEGF agents plus licensed intravitreal steroid implants with at least one year follow-up.

Competing risks regression models showed that patients on tenofovir were 20-95% less likely to require a SDS than patients on stavudine, whereas patients on zidovudine had a 75-85% decrease in the hazards of SDS when compared to stavudine. ### conclusion The decline in SDS in the first 24 months on treatment appears to be associated with phasing out stavudine for zidovudine or tenofovir in first-line ART in our study. Further efforts to decrease the cost of tenofovir and zidovudine for use in this setting is warranted to substitute all patients still receiving stavudine."}

The present review discusses the diagnosis and management of refractory shock to offer guidance for management of this important clinical problem and to provide a framework for future research."}

In all patients the following factors were analyzed: tumor response, overall survival (OS), progression free survival, hematological and non-hematological toxicity . ### results Colon was the primary localization in almost two thirds of patients. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups according to the age, hematological and non-hematological toxicity, as well as in achieved OS. Progression free survival expressed in months was in average 5 months though with a large range between minimal and maximal survival time. ### conclusion Both groups have shown equivalent efficacy to applied chemotherapy protocols. Overall survival in the two groups matched data from the literature. Further research should confirm success of the combination of chemotherapy protocols and their combination with the biological therapy."}

Cell survival was measured by MTT assay. The activity of caspase-3 was determined by caspase-3 assays and the soft agar colony assay was used to test the colony formation of HCT116 cells in soft agar.

This sequential combination therapy not only inhibits tumor cell growth more strongly compared to other combination therapies but also significantly reduces colony formation in soft agar and augments apoptosis of HCT116 cells. Sequencing of docetaxel followed 1 h later by flavopiridol, followed 24 h later by 5-FU in xenograft models, also resulted in delayed tumor growth and higher survival rate. ### conclusion These results highlight the importance of an administrative schedule when combining docetaxel with flavopiridol and 5-FU, providing a rationale explanation for its development in clinical trials."}

We summarize efficacy and safety results from phase I/II and III trials, and discuss this regimen within the landscape of treatment for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer progressing after two lines of HER2-directed treatment. ### Expert Opinion Neratinib plus capecitabine is a valid treatment option for patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, after progression to at least two anti-HER2-based regimens. Given the multiple options that are being developed in this context, efforts should be employed to establish strong predictive biomarkers of efficacy to each drug and combination."}

The majority of conventional first-line therapies are noncurative and are only used to treat disease that is symptomatic or progressive and include chlorambucil, monotherapy with purine analogues, and combination chemotherapy. Immunotherapeutic agents such as rituximab and alemtuzumab may be indicated in select patient populations. However, because clinical trials have found that overall survival does not depend on the initial therapy, selection of first-line therapy should be based on patient-specific factors and the patient's goals for therapy with respect to response, survival, and symptom palliation. Progression-free survival time and time to treatment are critical endpoints for CLL treatment. An increasingly important endpoint is minimal residual disease (MRD), as it is considered to be the major cause of relapse in CLL. Finally, comparison of toxicities between different therapies is critical in CLL, as it is in other disease states. Several new agents are currently being evaluated for use in CLL, including alvocidib, oblimersen, and lumiliximab. ### conclusion Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with CLL.

Therapy is currently based on corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators. However, response to these therapies is highly variable, sometimes without meaningful improvement, especially in more fibrosing forms. Pirfenidone and nintedanib have recently demonstrated to reduce functional decline in patients with IPF. However, their antifibrotic mechanism makes these two drugs an interesting approach for treatment of fibrosing ILDs other than IPF. ### objectives We here report our experience with antifibrotic drugs in fibrosing non-IPF ILDs patients having a progressive phenotype during immunosuppressive therapy. ### methods Patients with a multidisciplinary team diagnosis of fibrosing non-IPF ILDs experiencing a progressive phenotype during treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators between October-2014 and January-2018 at our tertiary referral Center for ILDs were retrospectively analyzed. Antifibrotic therapy was administered after application with the respective health insurance company and after consent by the patient. Pulmonary-function-tests and follow-up visits were performed every 6\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009months. ### results Eleven patients were treated with antifibrotic drugs (8 males, mean age 62\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8\u2009years, mean FVC% 62.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.3, mean DLCO% 35.5\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7, median follow-up under antifibrotic treatment 11.1\u2009months).

Tofacitinib is approved in the United States for use in adults with moderately to severely active RA and an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. ### objectives To (a) evaluate, using an economic model, the treatment costs of an RA strategy including tofacitinib, compared with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and tocilizumab biologic RA treatment strategies, which are commonly prescribed in the United States, and (b) assess the economic impact of monotherapy and combination therapy in patients who had an inadequate response to methotrexate therapy (MTX-IR analysis) and to combination therapy in patients who had an inadequate response to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-IR analysis). ### methods A transparent, Excel-based economic model with a decision-tree approach was developed to evaluate costs over a 1- and 2-year time horizon. The model compared tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day (BID) either as monotherapy or in combination with MTX with similarly labeled biologic therapies. Response to treatment was modeled as American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response. ACR20 represented clinical response and determined whether patients continued therapy. ACR response rates at 6-month intervals were sourced from prescribing information and safety event rates from a published meta-analysis. Following an adverse event or a lack of response to treatment, it was assumed that 75% of patients switched to the next line of treatment (first to abatacept and then to rituximab). The perspective was that of a U.S. payer. Costs were reported in 2015 U.S. dollars and included drug wholesale acquisition costs, monitoring, drug administration, and treatment for minor and serious adverse events. The patient population eligible for treatment was based on the total number of members (i.e., RA and non-RA) in a payer organization; members with RA treated with biologic therapies were estimated using epidemiological data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of varying key parameters, including treatment-switching probability, product rebate, major rates of adverse drug reaction, and ACR20 rates, on the model outcomes. ### results Tofacitinib combination therapy after MTX failure was associated with the lowest cost per member per month (PMPM) over a 2-year time frame at $5.53, compared with $6.49 for adalimumab, $6.43 for etanercept, $5.95 for certolizumab, and $5.89 for tocilizumab.

Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that tofacitinib would potentially be cost saving even in the least optimistic scenarios. ### conclusions This analysis suggests that tofacitinib 5 mg BID following MTX failure is a lower cost per patient treatment option when used either as monotherapy or combination therapy, compared with adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and tocilizumab biologic regimens. Tofacitinib + MTX in TNF-IR patients was also predicted to be a lower-cost treatment option compared with adalimumab+MTX and was associated with the lowest cost per ACR 20/50/70 responder. ### disclosures This study was funded by Pfizer, which determined the research topic and paid York Health Economics Consortium to develop the analysis and conduct the research.

OVX rats were left untreated for two months and then were treated with vehicle (Veh), hPTH (1-34) (PTH), alendronate (Aln), or raloxifene (Ral) sequentially for three month intervals, for a total of three periods. Mid-tibial cortical bone architecture, mass, mineralization, and strength were measured on necropsy samples obtained after each period. Bone indentation properties were measured on proximal femur necropsy samples. ### results Eight or more months of estrogen deficiency in rats resulted in decreased cortical bone area and thickness. Treatment with PTH for 3months caused the deposition of endocortical lamellar bone that increased cortical bone area, thickness, and strength. These improvements were lost when PTH was withdrawn without followup treatment, but were maintained for the maximum times tested, six months with Ral and three months with Aln. Pre-treatment with anti-resorptives was also somewhat successful in ultimately preserving the additional endocortical lamellar bone formed under PTH treatment. These treatments did not affect bone indentation properties. ### summary Sequential therapy that involved both PTH and anti-resorptive agents was required to achieve lasting improvements in cortical area, thickness, and strength in OVX rats. Anti-resorptive therapy, either prior to or following PTH, was required to preserve gains attributable to an anabolic agent."}

Twelve patients withdrew because of adverse events during the 24-week treatment period. ### Main Outcome Measures Efficacy was measured by evaluating immunological and viral load changes, and safety was assessed by evaluating clinical manifestations and laboratory indexes of toxic effects. ### results Patients receiving low- or high-dose combination therapy had greater treatment effects compared with patients receiving continued zidovudine monotherapy during the first 24 weeks as documented by changes in CD4+ cell counts (+0.04 vs +0.03 vs -0.02 x 10(9)/L, respectively; P < .001); log10 HIV-1 RNA as measured by the Roche assay (-0.96 vs -0.77 vs +0.07 copies/mL, respectively; P < .001) or log10 HIV-1 RNA measured by the quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay (-0.59 vs -1.06 vs -0.02 copies/mL, respectively; P < .011); and immune-complex dissociated (ICD) p24 antigen (-74% vs -68% vs +27%, respectively; P < .001). There were no statistically significant differences in viral measurements, in CD4+ cell counts, or in safety profile between the groups receiving 2 doses of lamivudine in combination with zidovudine. The effects on CD4+ cell counts and ICD p24 antigen were sustained throughout 48 weeks for patients continuing combination therapy. Patients switching to combination therapy at week 24 showed improvement. ### conclusion In zidovudine-experienced HIV-1-infected patients, combination treatment with lamivudine and zidovudine is well tolerated and provides greater and more sustained increases in CD4+ cell counts and decreases in viral load than continued zidovudine monotherapy."}

Samples for viable counts and endotoxin analysis were drawn immediately before and after the addition of the antibiotics and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For the analysis of endotoxin, a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay was used. ### results Endotoxin liberation was found to be proportional to the number of killed bacteria for each antibiotic regimen at each concentration level justifying the endotoxin-liberating potential to be expressed as release of endotoxin per killed bacterium, an expression that was independent of the inoculum size. At all concentration levels there was a statistically significant difference between the treatments, with the highest release of endotoxin per killed bacterium for cefuroxime, lower for tobramycin and the lowest for the combination of the two drugs (P < 0.001). With increasing doses, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the propensity to release endotoxin. When the bacterial killing rate was correlated to the propensity to release endotoxin in bacteria exposed to tobramycin or the combination of tobramycin and cefuroxime, a significant negative correlation was found (P < 0.01). This reduction in endotoxin release was not caused by an unspecific endotoxin binding of tobramycin. ### conclusions Addition of tobramycin reduced the cefuroxime-induced endotoxin release per killed bacterium to a level which was even lower than that of tobramycin alone in spite of an increased killing rate. Increasing concentrations of tobramycin led to reduction in endotoxin release, which may be of benefit when dosing aminoglycosides once daily."}

In the cetuximab arm, CEA responders showed a significantly longer progression-free survival [11.8 versus 7.4 months; hazard ratio (HR) 1.53; 95% Cl, 1.15-2.04; P = 0.004] and longer overall survival (36.6 versus 21.3 months; HR 1.73; 95% Cl, 1.24-2.43; P = 0.001) than CEA non-responders. Analysis of extended RAS wild-type patients revealed similar results. ### conclusion In the FIRE-3 trial, CEA decrease was significantly faster and greater in the cetuximab arm than in the bevacizumab arm and correlated with the prolonged survival observed in patients receiving FOLFIRI plus cetuximab. ### Clinical Trials Number NCT00433927 (ClinicalTrials.gov); AIO KRK0306 FIRE-3."}

Since azoles come in many varieties, we tested three typical azole motifs representing a broad range of azole and azole-type inhibitors: methylimidazolate, methyltriazolate, and pyridine. These structural motifs represent typical azoles, such as econazole, fluconazole, and metyrapone.

This process leads to the breaking of a hydrogen bond between the resting state water molecule and the approaching inhibitor molecule. Although, formally, the water molecule is released in the first step of the reaction mechanism and a pentacoordinated heme is created, this does not lead to an observed spin state crossing.

Furthermore, our group has shown that the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective in anthracycline-resistant ABC. ### Patients And Methods From January 1996 until March 1997, 66 women with ABC were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) by three-hour infusion followed by carboplatin at an AUC of 6 mg x min/ml every three weeks. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 28-75). A total of 39 patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy and 22 of them were treated with an anthracycline or mitoxantrone-containing regimen. ### results A total of 324 cycles (median: six) were administered, 273 (85%) of them at full dose. The median number of delivered cycles was six. The median delivered dose intensity (DI) of paclitaxel was 55.1 mg/m2/week (range 30.5-69.3) and the relative DI was 0.95 (range 0.5-1.2). Eight patients (12%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5%-22%) achieved complete and 28 (42%, 95% CI: 30%-55%) partial responses. Grade 3-4 toxicities included anemia (5%), granulocytopenia (24%), thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting and allergic reaction (3% each), myalgias/arthralgias and neurotoxicity (1.5% each). Febrile neutropenia occurred in eight (12%) patients. Alopecia was universal. After a median follow-up of 17.3 (range 0.07-24.5) months, 48 (72%) patients have demonstrated tumor progression and 24 (36%) have died. Median time to progression was 8.6 (range 0.07-23+) months and median survival 20.4 (range 0.07-24.5+) months. ### conclusions The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin has moderate activity in ABC and can be easily delivered on an outpatient basis with manageable toxicity. This regimen may be useful especially in patients to whom anthracyclines or cisplatin administration is precluded because of other concomitant diseases."}

In the 450-mg cohort, four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. In the 300-mg cohort, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities.

Several human cancers express SSTRs, including prostate cancer, and therefore SMS is of interest for anti-cancer therapy. DNA methylation and histone modifications are involved in normal cell development, gene imprinting and human carcinogenesis. Reversing DNA methylation is an attractive therapeutic possibility, since epigenetic modifications change gene expression without changing the gene function. DNA methylation inhibitors such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5'-aza, decitabine) have been used to treat several types of haematological malignancies. Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as trichostatin (TSA), are a new class of 'targeted anti-cancer agents'. TSA and decitabine can induce growth arrest, apoptosis or terminal differentiation in a variety of solid and haematological cancers in advanced disease patients. In the present study, the LNCaP cell line (prostate cancer) was incubated with SMS or Somadex (an SMS polymer conjugate) for three days, 1 nM per day, and the untreated cells were the negative control. For DNA demethylation, cells were grown in the presence of 2.5 microM 5-aza for 120 h, and re-fed with 5-aza-containing fresh medium at day 3. The total incubation time with 5-aza was 120 h. TSA at 1.0 microM was added into the cultured cells for 24 h. The combined treatment of 5-aza and TSA was performed by incubating the cells with 5-aza for 120 h followed by a 24-h exposure to TSA. Using cDNA obtained from these cell lines, the difference in the expression level of SSTR mRNA transcripts before and after 5-aza and TSA treatments was analyzed by RT-PCR. An increased induction of mRNA expression of the five SSTR subtypes was observed in the LNCaP cells when incubated with SMS/Somadex (dose-dependent). The inhibition of DNA methylation and histone acetylation resulted in the up-regulation of SSTR5 mRNA expression. The results demonstrate a positive feedback loop between SMS and its receptors. This regulation pathway may enhance the anti-tumor activity of somatostatin. To benefit from this effect in a clinical setting, the dose, dose frequency and pan affinity of the SMS derivative are important factors. The epigenetic manipulation with DNA methylation or histone deacetylase inhibitors, combined with SMS, may offer a novel alternative for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer."}

Sulfamethoxazole can promote a bactericidal response with trimethoprim in E. coli K-12 and some of its resistant derivatives, but only under a narrow range of concentrations."}

The safety of this strategy needs to be investigated. Data from subgroup analysis from clinical trials with DOAC do not clarify whether 4-week treatment with DOAC is sufficient to prevent thromboembolism (TE) after cardioversion. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the incidence of TE in anticoagulant naive patients converted after one month's pre-treatment with dabigatran. ### Methods And Results We scrutinized the medical records of 631 patients where dabigatran had been used prior to elective DC cardioversion. Transoesophageal echocardiography was rarely performed. Thromboembolism within 30 days of cardioversion was the primary endpoint. A total of 570 patients were naive to OAC when dabigatran was initiated. The mean age in this group was 64.2 \u00b1 11 years and 31.7% were women. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 2.0 \u00b1 1.5.

Cardiac events occurred after posaconazole administration, incriminating posaconazole use, alone or in combination with voriconazole, as the culpable agent. ### Case Report A 26-year-old female patient underwent orthopedic surgery to remove ectopic calcifications in her left hip joint. On the first post-operative day she became septic due to a surgical wound infection. Despite being treated according to the therapeutic protocols for sepsis, no clinical improvement was noticed and further assessment revealed an underlying immunodeficiency. Considering the underlying immunodeficiency and to that point poor clinical response, an antifungal agent was added to the antibiotic regiment. Following discontinuation of multiple antifungal agents due to adverse effects, posaconazole was administered. Posaconazole oral intake was followed by episodes of bradycardia and QT interval prolongation. The patient suffered continuous incidents of cardiac arrest due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades des pointes) that degenerated to lethal ventricular fibrillation. Posaconazole was immediately discontinued and a temporary pacemaker was installed. The patient finally recovered without any neurological deficit, and was discharged in a good clinical status. ### conclusions Close cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases where posaconazole administration is combined with coexisting risk factors, as they may lead to severe ECG abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias such as long QT interval syndrome and torsades de pointes. Posaconazole interactions with medications metabolized via the CYP3A4 pathway should be considered an additional risk factor for lethal cardiac incidents."}

In patients treated with decitabine plus VA, dose-limiting encephalopathy occurred in two of two patients at VA 25 mg/kg/d and one of six patients at VA 20 mg/kg/d. Drug-induced re-expression of estrogen receptor (ER) was associated with clinical response (P < or = .05).

In Group A, 3 (15%) patients achieved a partial response; in Group B, 1 (3%) patient achieved a partial response. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 3.3 and 8.2 months in Group A and 1.9 and 5.0 months in Group B, respectively. Common serious toxicities were diarrhea, fatigue, and anorexia. Patients with high serum VEGF had a median PFS of 2.8 months versus 1.7 months for patients with low VEGF (P = .085). ### conclusions Docetaxel and irinotecan had acceptable toxicities, but efficacy results in unselected patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN did not suggest an advantage over docetaxel alone or platinum-based regimens."}

Although converting enzyme inhibitors have other potential metabolic effects, their beneficial effects in hypertension and congestive heart failure appear to be, in large part, related to their ability to reduce angiotensin II. This causes an increase in plasma renin levels and a fall in plasma and urine aldosterone, which can be sustained for many years.

Global DNA methylation levels, XPC mRNA and protein expression and methylation of the XPC promoter were examined. Apoptosis, cell proliferation and senescence were also quantified. XPC siRNA was used to determine that the responses seen were reliant on XPC induction. ### results Treatment with high-dose decitabine resulted in global demethylation, including the the shores of the XPC CpG island and significantly increased XPC mRNA expression. Lower, clinically relevant dose of decitabine also resulted in global demethylation including the CpG island shores and induced XPC in 50% of cell lines. Decitabine followed by DNA-damaging carboplatin treatment led to significantly higher XPC expression in 75% of melanoma cell lines tested. Combined sequential treatment also resulted in a greater apoptotic response in 75% of cell lines compared to carboplatin alone, and significantly slowed cell proliferation, with some melanoma cell lines going into senescence.

In 32 patients who received more than two courses of therapy the 50% survival time of responders was 27.0 months, which was significantly longer than the 10.3 months of nonresponders (P less than 0.05). Except for 2 patients who developed myocardial damage, the therapy was never terminated because of side effects. Cumulative cardiotoxicity was not apparent in this study. This multiple-drug combination chemotherapy with 'VEMFAH' is concluded to be an effective treatment for advanced and disseminated breast cancer."}

The efficacy of combining cetuximab with mitoxantrone (M) plus prednisone (MP) was evaluated in progressive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after receiving docetaxel. ### Materials And Methods Patients with progression after receiving docetaxel were eligible and randomized 2:1 to CMP or MP. Therapy was mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) intravenously (I.V.) on day 1, oral prednisone 10 mg daily in both arms, and cetuximab 250 mg/m(2) I.V. (400 mg/m(2) day 1, cycle 1) on days 1, 8, and 15 in the CMP arm. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. Radiologic assessments of disease and PSA (prostate-specific antigen) occurred every 4 cycles. The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP). ### results A total of 115 patients were enrolled, 75 in the CMP and 40 in the MP arm: the median TTP was 4.9 and 6.6 months, respectively; the measurable disease response rate was 2% and 4%, the PSA response rate 7.7% and 17.6%, and median survival 11.9 and 15.7 months, respectively. Key grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia 44% and 25.6%, anemia 6.7% and 7.7%, thrombocytopenia 6.7% and 2.6%, and fatigue 8% in both arms. In an unplanned exploratory analysis, median TTP with (n = 24) and without rash (n = 51) in the CMP arm was 10.3 months vs. 2.8 months (P = .004). On multivariable analysis,rash was significantly associated with TTP (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43; P = .01). ### conclusions The treatment with CMP is not recommended in unselected men with docetaxel-treated CRPC, although rash might help develop tailored therapy."}

Depression-like behavior was characterized by forced swim and tail suspension tests, and via automatic measurement of sucrose preference in IntelliCage. The Homer1 mRNA expression and promoter DNA methylation were analyzed in cortex and peripheral blood by qRT-PCR and pyrosequencing. ### results CDM mice show decreased Homer1a and Homer1b/c mRNA expression in cortex and blood samples, while chronic treatment with imipramine and fluoxetine or acute ketamine application increases their level only in the cortex.

Generic statins could change the cost effectiveness of statin therapies in Spain, and more population groups could be included in the recommendations for reduction of cholesterol levels based on cost effectiveness. ### objectives The objectives of this study were: (i) to assess the cost effectiveness of available statins for the reduction of LDL-C levels in Spain in 2010, after the introduction of generics and reference prices; (ii) to assess the cost effectiveness of combination therapy using a statin plus cholestyramine or ezetimibe; and (iii) to estimate the mean cost per patient to achieve National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel-III) therapeutic objectives. ### methods The following treatments were evaluated: rosuvastatin 5-20\u2009mg/day; atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin 10-40\u2009mg/day; lovastatin and fluvastatin 20-80\u2009mg/day; and combination therapy with a statin plus either cholestyramine 12-24\u2009g/day or ezetimibe 10\u2009mg/day. The cost effectiveness was evaluated in terms of cost per percentage point reduction in LDL-C, comparing the annual treatment costs with the effectiveness in reducing LDL-C. Treatment costs included those for medications (2010 wholesale prices), control measures, and treatment of adverse drug effects. The effectiveness of statins was estimated by developing a meta-analysis of clinical trials published between 1993 and 2005 that met several inclusion criteria. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to assess the efficiency of individual statin and combination therapies in reducing LDL-C levels. ### results The effectiveness in terms of percentage reduction in LDL-C ranged from 19% for pravastatin 10\u2009mg/day to 55% for atorvastatin 80\u2009mg/day. Annual treatment costs ranged from Euro 189.7 for simvastatin 10\u2009mg/day to Euro 759.3 for atorvastatin 80\u2009mg/day.

Simvastatin was the most cost-effective statin to achieve the LDL-C goal in patients with moderate or low CHD risk, with a cost per patient of Euro 217 and Euro 190, respectively. ### conclusion Rosuvastatin should be the first-choice agent in patients with high CHD risk, while simvastatin should be the first choice in patients with moderate or low risk. The addition of ezetimibe to rosuvastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin should be the preferred combination therapies when greater LDL-C reductions are required.

Our recent research has focused on the release patterns and effects of oxytocin and vasopressin in brain areas, such as the septum and hypothalamus, that are thought to be involved in the regulation of (1) behavioural responses and (2) responses of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS) to stressor exposure in rats. The results demonstrate that combined physical and emotional stress (induced by exposure to forced swimming) selectively triggers the release of vasopressin within all brain areas under study but not into the general circulation. Under emotional stress conditions (induced by exposure to the 'social defeat' procedure), however, oxytocin rather than vasopressin release increased within the hypothalamus and septum. Experiments aimed at revealing the neuroendocrine and behavioural relevance of the local nonapeptide release provided evidence for an involvement of vasopressin in the regulation of HNS activity (within the hypothalamus) and, moreover, in acute stress-coping strategies, anxiety-related behaviour and learning and memory processes (within the septum). The observed dissociation between central and peripheral nonapeptide release not only supports the hypothesis that plasma vasopressin and oxytocin concentrations do not necessarily reflect central release patterns but also suggests vasopressin and oxytocin neurones are able to independently release their nonapeptide from different parts of their neuronal surface (e.g. from somata/dendrites vs. axon terminals). This remarkable regulatory capacity provides the basis for an differential involvement of vasopressin, and probably also oxytocin, in the co-ordination of neuroendocrine activity, emotionality and cognition at different brain levels to ensure an appropriate behavioural response of the organism to stressful stimuli."}

Clinician- and patient-reported toxicities were collected each week during treatment. We fit binomial generalized linear models to maximum toxicity scores across all patients' visits. ### results Of 123 patients with\u00a0\u2265 4 PRO assessments, 87 (71%) patients reported a clinically meaningful PRO score of 3 or higher for diarrhea, and 91 (74%) patients reported a PRO score of\u00a0\u2265 3 for urgency, during 1 or more weeks of treatment, corresponding to 'very frequent' or worse. Of 116 patients who had also completed\u00a0\u2265 4 clinician-reported assessments for descriptive analysis, clinically significant diarrhea (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade\u00a0\u2265 2) was reported in 9% of patients, and grade 2 proctitis and cystitis were reported in 20% and 4%, respectively. Eighty-four (68%) patients had undergone induction chemotherapy prior to CRT. Patients who received induction chemotherapy had 68% lower odds of experiencing significant urgency (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.95; P\u00a0= .04), 76% lower odds of bleeding (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.1-0.62; P\u00a0< .01), and 75% lower odds of tenesmus (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.6; P\u00a0< .01) versus those treated with upfront CRT. ### conclusion Based on PROs, a high proportion of patients experienced clinically significant symptoms during pelvic CRT, with diarrhea and urgency being most commonly reported. This appears to be under-reported on clinician-reported assessments. Delivery of induction chemotherapy was associated with lower odds of experiencing urgency, bleeding, and tenesmus on PROs during subsequent CRT, with no significant impact on diarrhea and rectal pain."}

To assess the efficacy and safety of this new combination and to define its optimum dosage regimen (once or twice daily) in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, a multicentre clinical study was conducted. ### methods A multicentre, randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, parallel-group study was conducted in five African centers in Cameroon, Madagascar, Mali and Senegal from March to December 2006. Efficacy and safety of ASAQ were assessed compared to those of artemether + lumefantrine (AL). The WHO protocol with a 28-day follow-up for assessing the drug therapeutic efficacy was used. Patients suffering from uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomized to receive ASAQ orally once daily (ASAQ1), ASAQ twice daily (ASAQ2) or AL twice daily (AL) for three days. The primary outcome was PCR-corrected parasitological cure rate and clinical response. ### results Of 941 patients initially randomized and stratified into two age groups (<5 years, and >or=5 years), 936 (99.5%) were retained for the intent to treat (ITT) analysis, and 859 (91.3%) patients for the per protocol (PP) analysis. Among ITT population, up to D28, PCR-corrected adequate parasitological and clinical response rates were 95.2% in the ASAQ1 group, 94.9% in the ASAQ2 group and 95.5% in the AL group. Moreover, the cure rate evaluated among PP population was >or=98.5% in both ASAQ therapeutic arms. Therapeutic response rates did not display any significant differences between age groups or between one geographical site and another. Altogether, this demonstrates the non-inferiority of ASAQ1 regimen compared to both ASAQ2 and AL regimens. During follow-up mild and moderate adverse events including gastrointestinal and/or nervous disorders were reported in 29.3% of patients, with no difference between groups in the nature, frequency or intensity of adverse events. ### conclusion The non-inferiority of ASAQ compared with AL was demonstrated. The fixed-dose combination artesunate + amodiaquine (ASAQ) is safe and efficacious even in young children under 5 years of age. Whilst administration on a twice-a-day basis does not improve the efficacy of ASAQ significantly, a once-a-day intake of this new combination clearly appears as an effective and safe therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria both in adults and children. Implications of such findings are of primary importance in terms of public health especially in African countries. As most national policies plan to strengthen malaria control to reach the elimination of this disease, anti-malarial drugs such as the artesunate + amodiaquine fixed-dose ACT will play a pivotal role in this process. ### Trial Registration The protocol was registered with the www.clinicaltrials.gov open clinical trial registry under the identifier number NCT00316329."}

Although elderly patients are commonly encountered in clinical practice, few studies have focused on the value of chemotherapy in elderly patients. In this study, we reviewed the use of docetaxel with prednisolone in elderly men (aged \u226580 years) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at Ningbo First Hospital with a focus on efficacy and toxicity. ### methods A retrospective study including a series of men aged \u226580 years with mCRPC and received docetaxel plus prednisone chemotherapy between August 2011 and May 2019. All these cases were selected from the Ningbo First Hospital prostate cancer database located in Zhejiang Province, China. ### results Sixteen patients were identified, with a mean age of 82 years (range, 80 to 87 years).

Twenty-one received norethisterone (5 mg twice a day on days 19 and 26) and 25 received tranexamic acid (1 g four times daily on days 1 to 4) for two cycles. ### Main Outcome Measures Menstrual blood loss was measured using the alkaline haematin method. Haematological assessments were made both at the beginning and at the end of the study, questionnaires were given to assess subjective endpoints, and patients were asked to report any adverse events during all cycles. ### results Tranexamic acid reduced mean menstrual blood loss by 45%, from 175 ml to 97 ml (95% CI for the difference in menstrual blood loss 52 to 108, P < 0.0001), norethisterone increased mean blood loss by 20% from 173 ml to 208 ml (95% CI for the difference in menstrual blood loss -64 to 2, P = 0.26). Fourteen (56%) women who received tranexamic acid achieved a mean menstrual loss of less than 80 ml per cycle during treatment, but only two (9.5%) who received norethisterone achieved this mean menstrual loss. There were no serious adverse events reported for either drug. ### conclusions Tranexamic acid is a safe and effective form of medical therapy in women with menorrhagia and is highly likely to normalise blood loss in women losing 80 to 200 ml prior to treatment. Norethisterone at this dose is not effective therapy for ovulatory menorrhagia."}

Telomerase activity is essential for survival of malignant cells and as such is considered a valid therapeutic target. This study evaluated the effects of bortezomib on telomerase activity and its regulation in MCL cells in vitro and ex vivo. Our study shows that bortezomib exerts a cytotoxic effect in a dose dependent manner in two MCL cell lines, with differential sensitivity. While the IC50 for HBL-2 cells ranged between 2.5 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml during 24-72 h respectively, the IC50 for the NCEB cells was twice. Bortezomib differentially inhibited telomerase activity (TA): in HBL-2 cells there was a decline of 20%-55% during 24-72 h respectively. However in NCEB cells the decline was much smaller, and did not exceed 25%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were eligible. Sequential and concurrent schedules were studied.  RESULTS: Forty-three patients were studied in 9 different dose levels (6 sequential and 3 concurrent). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on the sequential schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg three times a day on days 6-12. The MTD on the concurrent schedule was decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 with vorinostat 200 mg twice a day on days 3-9. However, the sequential schedule of decitabine 10 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and vorinostat 200 mg twice a day on days 6-12 was more deliverable than both MTDs with fewer delays on repeated dosing and it represents the recommended phase II (RP2D) dose of this combination. Dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle consisted of myelosuppression, constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms and occurred in 12/42 (29%) patients evaluable for toxicity. The most common \u2265 grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (49% of patients), thrombocytopenia (16%), fatigue (16%), lymphopenia (14%), and febrile neutropenia (7%). Disease stabilization for \u2265 4 cycles was observed in 11/38 (29%) evaluable patients.  CONCLUSION: The combination of decitabine with vorinostat is tolerable on both concurrent schedules in previously treated patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The sequential schedule was easier to deliver. The combination showed activity with prolonged disease stabilization in different tumor types."}

Group 1 included 20 patients with unresectable disease who received combined RT and LV/5-FU. Group 2 included 11 patients with unresectable disease who received preoperative RT. Group 3 included 21 patients with invasive, resectable, primary disease who received preoperative RT. ### results Patients with unresectable disease who received LV/5-FU had a higher rate of pathologic complete response (20% v 0%) and a lower incidence of positive nodes (30% v 64%) compared with those who did not receive chemotherapy. Even when the most favorable group of patients was included (group 3), patients who received LV/5-FU still had a higher complete response rate (20% v 6%) and a lower incidence of positive nodes (30% v 53%) compared with those who received RT without LV/5-FU. Of those patients with initially unresectable disease, the resectability rate was higher in those who received LV/5-FU compared with those who did not receive LV/5-FU (90% v 64%).

The ultimate impact of a complete response as well as a decrease in the incidence of pelvic nodes on local control and survival remains to be determined.

Hypothetical cohorts with moderate to severe RA were simulated. The primary outcome measure-quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)-was derived from disease severity (HAQ scores). Primary analysis included drug costs, monitoring costs, and other costs. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Treatment sequences that included TNF antagonists and rituximab produced a greater number of QALYs than tDMARDs alone or TNF antagonists plus DMARDs. In comparison with tDMARDs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab without rituximab were $77,357.7, $26,562.4 and $57,838.4 per QALY and $66,422.9, $28,780.6 and $50,937.6 per QALY, for etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab with rituximab. No biotherapy was cost-effective under the willingness to pay threshold when the threshold was 3 times the per capita GDP of China. When 3 times the per capita GDP of Shanghai used as the threshold, infliximab and rituximab could yield nearly 90% cost-effective simulations in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. ### Conclusions Significance tDMARD was the most cost-effective option in the Chinese healthcare setting. In some relatively developed regions in China, infliximab and rituximab may be a favorable cost-effective alternative for moderate to severe RA."}

Although HER-2 status, assessed by either HER-2/CEP-17 ratio-based FISH or copy number-based FISH, was a predictor of NAC sensitivity, ratio-assessed HER-2 status had a poorer performance in determining patients' responsiveness to NAC (p = .029). Patients who were not HER-2 amplified when assessed using the HER-2/CEP-17 ratio but were HER-2 amplified when assessed using copy number (~5%) were eventually proven to be responsive to NAC, with a pCR rate of 57% (95% CI, 18.4%-90.1%). In contrast, patients who were HER-2 amplified when assessed by the ratio but not HER-2 amplified when assessed using copy number (~3%) were completely irresponsive. Higher HER-2 copy numbers represented increasing chances of a pCR (adjusted odds ratio, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.35-7.08), with an apparent gene-dose effect (p for trend < .001). ### conclusion It is likely that HER-2 copy number but not the HER-2/CEP-17 ratio determines NAC sensitivity.

When systemic treatments without local measures were taken into account, lung metastases, cutaneous/subcutaneous metastases and adrenal metastases performed significantly better than liver metastases. When different treatment modalities were considered, there was no significant difference between the three local measures applied (radiotherapy, gamma knife radiosurgery and hyperthermia). Among the systemic therapies, dacarbazine high dose and carboplatin monochemotherapy were superior to combined regimens using fotemustine.

After the 6-month treatment, most participants showed an improved menstrual pattern. There were statistically significant decreases in acne scores, weight, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and serum testosterone. The metabolic indexes of insulin, carbohydrates, and lipids were improved obviously compared with the baseline in each group. Among the three groups, the patients administered 1,500 mg/day metformin experienced greater reductions in weight. However, the rosiglitazone users (alone or combined with metformin) showed a more notable decline in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. ### Conclusion S Considering the benefits of metformin on weight loss, high-dose metformin (1,500 mg/day) along with lifestyle modification should be recommended for obese, insulin-resistant women with PCOS. Rosiglitazone alone or combined with low-dosage metformin plus lifestyle modification should be considered for the women with abnormal lipid profiles. ### Clinical Trial Registration Number ChiCTR-TRC-13003642 (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry)."}

A history of an antecedent hematologic disorder, male sex, and absence of Auer rods were adverse factors for achieving remission in this older population. More than half of the patients achieved remission in one course. The major cause of failure to obtain a remission was death due to infection, 40% of which were caused by fungi. Resistance to chemotherapy, although uncommon, was noted more frequently in patients with an antecedent hematologic disorder.

No significant difference in remission rate was detected. Cyclocytidine was used as a maintenance agent in this study, and while the median remission duration was only 37 wk, 30% of patients are expected to be in remission for 2 yr.

Treatment was given daily for 7 days after the onset of colitis, by rectal installation. Clinical signs of disease were assessed daily using a disease activity index. After 19 days, all animals were killed and colon samples collected for histological grading and mRNA/protein analysis.

The antitumour effects in the MDR HL-60 xenografted tumour were stealthy liposomal topotecan (SLT) plus amlodipine > SLT > un-encapsulated topotecan > blank control.", "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy as the over-expressed MDR protein acts as an efflux pump, which leads to a reduction in the uptake of the anticancer agent by tumour cells. We combined topotecan and amlodipine together into the stealthy liposomes, in which amlodipine was applied as a MDR reversing agent to overcome the resistance. ### Materials And Methods Cytotoxicity, apoptosis and the signalling pathway assays were performed on human chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562, promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 and MDR HL-60 cells, respectively. Pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity studies were performed on normal Kunming mice and female BALB/c nude mice with MDR HL-60 xenografts, respectively. ### results Topotecan alone was effective in inhibiting the growth of non-resistant leukaemia cells, K562 and HL-60 cells but not the growth of MDR HL-60 cells. The resistance of topotecan in MDR HL-60 cells was potently reversed by the addition of amlodipine. Moreover, amlodipine enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of topotecan synergistically. Apoptosis was through activating caspases in a cascade: first, the initiator caspase 8 and then effectors caspase 3/7 (total activity of caspases 3 and 7) were activated. Being encapsulated into the stealthy liposomes with an acidic internal medium, topotecan existed dominantly in an active lactone species, which was reversibly changed from an inactive carboxylate form via a pH-dependent reaction. After administration of stealthy liposomes to mice, the blood exposure of the lactone form was evidently increased and extended. The antitumour effects in the MDR HL-60 xenografted tumour were stealthy liposomal topotecan (SLT) plus amlodipine > SLT > un-encapsulated topotecan > blank control. ### conclusions The enhanced antitumour activity in the MDR HL-60 cells by the SLT plus amlodipine could be owing to multiple reasons: (a) synergistic apoptosis inducing effect, (b) reversing MDR by amlodipine and (c) increasing the availability of active lactone of topotecan by the stealthy liposomes. The apoptosis induced by amlodipine is through caspase 8 and then the 3/7 signalling pathway."}

The threshold dose that depressed EEG activity was compared with the dose required to inhibit by 50% the peripheral bronchospasm elicited by 10 micrograms/kg i.v., of histamine.

Loratadine had no EEG depressant activity at 100 mg/kg, i.v., a dose more than 170 times its ED50 (0.58 mg/kg, i.v.) against histamine bronchospasm. We were unable to evaluate the EEG effects of terfenadine, because it produced cardiovascular collapse at 10 mg/kg, i.v. Loratadine and promethazine did not produce adverse cardiovascular effects, nor did they alter normal ECG activity. Diphenhydramine produced bradycardia followed by a transient hypertensive phase without affecting the QTc interval. In contrast, terfenadine elicited hypotension, bradycardia and significant arrhythmogenic activity, causing a prolongation of the QTc interval and a torsades de pointes--like ventricular arrhythmia. Pharmacokinetic studies after i.v. administration of loratadine (30 and 100 mg/kg) demonstrated plasma levels of loratadine and its major metabolite descarboethoxyloratadine to be several orders of magnitude greater than levels found in humans at the clinical dose of 10 mg. ### conclusion The CNS depressant effects of H1 antihistamines are promethazine approximately diphenhydramine >> loratadine = placebo. Of the non-sedating antihistamines, loratadine was devoid of adverse cardiovascular effects whereas terfenadine caused a pronounced disruption of the normal ECG, characterized by a torsades de pointes-like effect."}

There is, however, concern about the risk of second malignancies (SM) in long-term survivors. We have analyzed the second malignancies in patients treated in the German Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. ### Materials And Methods From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991). The systemic treatment in both studies consisted of a four-drug-regimen (VACA = vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin; or VAIA = vincristine, actinomycin D, ifosfamide, and adriamycin) and a total number of four courses, each lasting nine weeks, was recommended by the protocol. Local therapy in curative patients was either complete surgery (n = 162), surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy with 36-46Gy (n = 274), or definitive radiotherapy with 46-60Gy (n = 212). The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years. ### results The overall survival of all patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years. Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM. Five of these were acute myelogenic leukemias (n = 4) or MDS (n = 1), and three were sarcomas. The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four AMLs, 96 months for the MDS and 82-136 months for the three sarcomas. The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years. Out of five patients with AML/MDS, three died of rapid AML-progression, and two are living with disease. Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of AML/MDS, but local therapy did influence the risk of secondary sarcomas. All three patients with secondary sarcomas had received radiotherapy; however, all three sarcomas were salvaged by subsequent treatment and are in clinical remission with a follow-up of 1 month, 4.3 years, and 7.5 years after the diagnosis of the secondary sarcoma. Thus far, SM contributed to less than 1 % (3/328) of all deaths in the CESS-studies. ### conclusions The risk of leukemia after treatment for Ewing's sarcoma is probably in the range of 2%. The risk of solid tumors also seems to be low within the first 10 years after treatment and remains in the range of 5 % after 15 years. In the CESS-studies, less than 1% of all deaths within the first 10 years after diagnosis were caused by SM. Effective salvage therapy for secondary sarcomas is feasible."}

Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus vs other limb vs axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no vs yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m ### findings Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 62\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b76-76\u00b76); 62\u00b73 months (IQR 46\u00b79-77\u00b71) for the MAP group and 61\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b75-75\u00b73) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group vs 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group vs 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b798 [95% CI 0\u00b778-1\u00b723]); hazards were non-proportional (p=0\u00b70003).

Incomplete neutrophil recovery, and to a lesser extent stomatitis, were dose-limiting. ### conclusion In combination with G-CSF, epirubicin 120 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 700 mg/m2 every 21 days was feasible (projected dose-intensity, 40 mg/m2/wk and 233 mg/m2/wk, respectively). Epirubicin 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 could be administered safely every 10 days, allowing a projected dose-intensity of 52.5 mg/m2/wk and 350 mg/m2/wk, respectively."}

To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of adapalene, a topical retinoid used as first-line therapy for acne vulgaris, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, evaluator-blinded, left-right comparative trial. ### methods Patients with non-small cell lung, colorectal, or head and neck cancer scheduled to receive anti-EGFR therapies were randomly assigned to once-daily adapalene application on one side of the face, with placebo on the other side. All patients had topical moisturizer coapplied to both sides of the face, and received oral minocycline. The primary endpoint was the difference in total facial lesion count of acne-like rash at 4\u2009weeks. Secondary endpoints included complete control rate (CCR) of acne-like rash (\u22645 facial lesions) and global skin assessment (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] scale, grade 0-4) at 4\u2009weeks.

In this trial, we evaluated the perioperative effects on C-reactive protein (CRP) that resulted from starting atorvastatin within seven days of noncardiac surgery. The objective was to identify anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin prior to conducting a large randomized trial with clinical end points. ### methods In a single centre, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial, sixty high cardiac risk participants over age 45 yr undergoing noncardiac surgery were assigned randomly to one of three groups to receive atorvastatin 80 mg (A) and/or placebo (P). Group AA (n = 26) received atorvastatin seven days before surgery, the day of surgery, and for seven days post surgery.

A variable proportion (5% to 40%) of the infected people develop clinical symptoms. Hence, hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality with hepatic fibrosis, end-stage liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma as the dominant clinical sequelae. Combination therapy with pegylated (peg) interferon-alpha and ribavirin achieves sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment) in approximately 40% to 80% of treated patients, depending on viral genotype. Recently, a new class of drugs have emerged for hepatitis C infection, the direct acting antivirals, which in combination with standard therapy or alone can lead to sustained virological response in 80% or more of treated patients. Aminoadamantanes, mostly amantadine, are antiviral drugs used for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. We have previously systematically reviewed amantadine versus placebo or no intervention and found no significant effects of the amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and on adverse events in patients with hepatitis C. Overall, we did not observe a significant effect of amantadine on sustained virological response.

Methodological domains were used to assess the risk of systematic errors ('bias').

The timeframe for measuring the composite outcome was insufficient in the included trials. There was low quality evidence that amantadine led to more participants who failed to achieve sustained virological response compared with ribavirin. This observation may be real or caused by systematic errors (bias), but it does not seem to be caused by random error (play of chance). Due to the low quality of the evidence, we are unable to determine definitively whether amantadine is less effective than other antivirals in patients with chronic hepatitis C. As it appears less likely that future trials assessing amantadine or potentially other aminoadamantanes for patients with chronic hepatitis C would show strong benefits, it is probably better to focus on the assessments of other direct acting antiviral drugs. We found no evidence assessing other aminoadamantanes in randomised clinical trials in order to recommend or refute their use."}

No evidence of recurrence of breast cancer has been noted 1 year after surgery. This result suggests that weekly administration of PTX and intraabdominal injection of CBDCA might be beneficial in the treatment of recurrent breast cancer associated with metastatic ovarian cancer and peritoneal dissemination after operation."}

Its effect in patients using fixed combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and longacting \u03b22 agonists is unknown. We postulated that roflumilast would reduce exacerbations in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at risk for exacerbations, even in combination with inhaled corticosteroid and longacting \u03b22 agonist treatment. ### methods For this 1-year double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre, phase 3-4 trial, the Roflumilast and Exacerbations in patients receiving Appropriate Combination Therapy (REACT) study, we enrolled patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from 203 centres (outpatient clinics, hospitals, specialised pulmonologists, and family doctors) in 21 countries. Eligible patients were 40 years of age or older with a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years and a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with severe airflow limitation, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, and at least two exacerbations in the previous year. We used a computerised central randomisation system to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment groups: roflumilast 500 \u03bcg or placebo given orally once daily together with a fixed inhaled corticosteroid and longacting \u03b22 agonist combination. Background tiotropium treatment was allowed. All patients and investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was the rate of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations per patient per year, analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01329029. ### findings Between April 3, 2011, and May 27, 2014, we enrolled 1945 eligible participants and randomly assigned 973 to the roflumilast group and 972 to the placebo group. The rate of moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations was 13\u00b72% lower in the roflumilast group than in the placebo group according to a Poisson regression analysis (roflumilast 0\u00b7805 vs placebo 0\u00b7927; rate ratio [RR] 0\u00b7868 [95% CI 0\u00b7753-1\u00b7002], p=0\u00b70529), and 14\u00b72% lower according to a predefined sensitivity analysis using negative binomial regression (0\u00b7823 vs 0\u00b7959; 0\u00b7858 [0\u00b7740-0\u00b7995], p=0\u00b70424). Adverse events were reported by 648 (67%) of 968 patients receiving roflumilast and by 572 (59%) of 967 patients in the placebo group; adverse event-associated patient withdrawal from the study was also more common in the roflumilast group (104/968 [11%]) than in the placebo group (52/967 [5%]). The most frequently reported serious adverse events were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and pneumonia, and 17 (1\u00b78%) deaths occurred in the roflumilast group compared with 18 (1\u00b79%) in the placebo group. ### interpretation Our findings suggest that roflumilast reduces exacerbations and hospital admissions in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic bronchitis who are at risk of frequent and severe exacerbations despite inhaled corticosteroid and longacting \u03b22 agonist therapy, even in combination with tiotropium. ### funding Takeda."}

Responsive patients and patients with operable stable disease underwent modified radical mastectomy followed by concurrent radiotherapy and CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) adjuvant chemotherapy. Thirty patients were evaluable for response to CAP. The rate of objective response to induction chemotherapy was 76.7% with 2 patients (6.7%) obtaining a complete response and 21 patients (70%) a partial response. Twenty-five patients were rendered disease-free after induction chemotherapy and surgery. Only 2 of these had pathological complete response (8%). The median overall survival was 48.7 months, the median time to progression was 22.4 months and the median disease-free survival was 29.1 months. The patients with noninflammatory breast tumor had a significantly better overall survival, disease-free survival, and time to progression. The overall survival and the time to progression were statistically superior in patients with primary tumor size < or = 8 cm. At a median follow-up of 6 years, 29% (95% CI, 13.05 to 45.01) of patients were alive and 28% (95% CI, 10.4 to 45.6) were disease-free. This combined modality treatment seems feasible with quite acceptable toxicity; the CAP combination is an effective alternative to the other standard chemotherapeutic regimens. Our results, although encouraging, are still poor, and new drugs and strategies are required to improve the long-term outcome."}

In imatinib-resistant GIST cells, we observed elevated expression of KIT and restoration of its kinase activity, as well as activation of multiple proliferative signaling pathways.

Risperidone has been shown to be effective in reducing or eliminating hot flushes on women with hormonal variations. In this present study, we demonstrated that combination of tamoxifen with risperidone did not interfered tamoxifen-induced cytotoxic effects in both in vitro and in vivo models, while fluoxetine abrogated the effects of tamoxifen. This is the first paper suggesting the possibility of combination treatment of tamoxifen with risperidone in breast cancer patients, providing a conceivable resolution of tamoxifen-induced side effects without interfering the efficacy of tamoxifen against breast cancer."}

Emphasis was placed on original studies published since 1975. ### Data Extraction Data from published research were extracted and evaluated according to study design, sample size, dosing regimen, outcome measures, and treatment efficacy and safety. ### Data Synthesis Infantile spasms constitute a rare epileptic syndrome with a poor long-term prognosis for normal intellectual development. The spasms are characterized by a brief symmetric contraction of the muscles of the neck, trunk, and/or extremities, often occurring in a series of 2 to more than 100 spasms during a single episode. The disorder is age-specific, with the peak onset of symptoms occurring between 2 and 8 months of age. Spasms of no identifiable cause in infants with normal development prior to the onset of infantile spasms are classified as cryptogenic or idiopathic, whereas those with an identifiable cause are classified as symptomatic. Long-term prognosis is best in cryptogenic cases, with 30-70 percent attaining normal intellect compared with 5-19 percent in symptomatic cases. The etiology and pathophysiology are not well understood. Recent theory postulates that infantile spasms may be caused by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone activity during infancy. The suspected association between the whole-cell pertussis vaccine and infantile spasms is coincidental. Few well-designed, prospective, controlled clinical trials for the treatment of infantile spasms have been conducted. ### conclusions Standard anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, the barbiturates, carbamazepine, and the succinimides have been ineffective. Of the anticonvulsants, only the benzodiazepines, valproic acid, and vigabatrin have shown efficacy in reducing spasm frequency and severity.

Among several factors, Aurora A (a mitotic serine threonine kinase) plays crucial roles in acquiring non-responsiveness towards doxorubicin. However, the mechanisms underlying need to be elucidated. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of Aurora A mediated doxorubicin insensitivity in MCF-7Dox/R, an isolated resistant-subline of MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma cell line). Effect of curcumin, a natural phytochemical in restoring doxorubicin sensitivity by targeting Aurora A was assessed furthermore. ### methods A doxorubicin resistant subline (MCF-7Dox/R) was isolated from the parental MCF-7 cells by treating the cell with gradual step-wise increasing concentration of the drug. Expressions of Aurora A and its target proteins (Akt, I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF\u03baB) were assessed in both parental and MCF-7Dox/R cells. Both the cell lines were pretreated with curcumin prior to doxorubicin treatment. Cellular proliferation rate was measured using BrdU (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) assay kit. Intracellular doxorubicin accumulation was estimated spectrofluorimetrically. Cellular uptake of curcumin (spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric method) and its nuclear localization was confirmed by confocal microscopic study. Protein expressions were determined by western blot analysis. Localization of Aurora A was ascertained by immunofluorescence assay. To explore the possible outcome of impact of curcumin on Aurora A, cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis were performed subsequently. ### results Higher expressions of Aurora A in MCF-7Dox/R cells led to phosphorylation of Akt as well as I\u03baB\u03b1. Phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 preceded release of NF\u03baB. Phospho-Akt, NF\u03baB consequentially decreased doxorubicin accumulation by enhancing the expressions of ABCG2 and Pgp1 respectively. Curcumin by regulating Aurora A and its target molecules sensitized resistant subline towards doxorubicin mediated G2/M-arrest and apoptosis. ### conclusion Molecular targeting of Aurora A by curcumin restores chemosensitivity by increasing the efficacy of doxorubicin in breast cancer.<br />."}

Kidney specimens were taken to investigate renal cytochrome p450 and for histological examinations. Cimetidine treatment significantly decreased creatinine, BUN, K, Na, SBP and creatine kinase and increased GFR and urine volume compared to group II. l-carnitine exerted similar changes except for the effect on K and GFR. NO was significantly decreased, while renal glutathione and cytochrome p450 were significantly increased in groups treated with l-carnitine or cimetidine as compared to group II. Combined treatment further improved renal functions, creatine kinase, oxidative stress parameters and SBP as compared to each therapy alone. The histological changes confirmed the biochemical findings. Cimetidine and l-carnitine have protective effects - almost equally - against mARF. Using both agents together, minimises the renal injury."}

Participants used varenicline (2 mg/day) or placebo for 2-8 weeks plus received brief counseling on methods to reduce cigarettes/day. The primary measure was the incidence of a quit attempt within 6 months of study entry. Secondary measures were point prevalence abstinence, motivation to stop smoking, and reduction in cigarettes/day. ### results Varenicline increased the incidence of a quit attempt more than placebo at the Nebraska site (73% vs. 41%; p < .001) but not at the Vermont site (45% vs. 51%; p = .45). Varenicline increased most other measures of quit attempts, motivation and abstinence, independent of site. The beneficial effects of varenicline in quit attempts appeared to be mediated by greater reductions in cigarettes/day, dependence, craving, and cigarette satisfaction. Varenicline had a greater effect on quit attempts in less-dependent smokers, in minority smokers, and in those who had less prior cessation or reduction activity. Adverse events were minimal. ### conclusions Varenicline increased quit attempts in smokers who are not currently trying to quit at one of the two study sites and improved most all secondary outcomes independent of site. This appeared to be due to decreasing cigarettes/day and level of dependence."}

Twenty patients (52.6%) had a PS of 2, and 6 (15.8%) had brain metastases. The most frequent toxicities were hypertension (all grades: 42.1%) and peripheral neuropathy (grade 2-3: 21.1%). Haematological toxicities included grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 anaemia and thrombopenia (5.3% each). Neither febrile neutropenia nor arterial thrombo-embolic event occurred. The objective response rate was 55.3% (95%CI: 39.5-71.1). The median PFS and OS were 6.2 (95%CI: 5.4-9.0) and 14.6 (95%CI: 9.8-19.5) months, respectively. ### conclusions In this single centre experience, the combination of pemetrexed, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab was well tolerated and had promising activity as first-line therapy in unselected patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC."}

After explantation, the catheters were assessed for bacterial adherence and biofilm formation, and the surrounding tissue was assessed for signs of toxicity. Before retrieval, systemic concentrations of antimicrobials were determined. ### Measurements And Main Results Sequential roll plate and centrifuging were used to detect moderately and tightly adherent bacteria on the outer and luminal surfaces of the catheter. The presence of biofilm was detected by scanning electron microscopy. Tissues surrounding the catheters were examined histopathologically; systemic concentrations of chlorhexidine, sulfadiazine, and silver were determined by atomic absorption and high-performance liquid chromatography. As compared with the controls, antiseptic catheters had significantly (p < .01) fewer moderately and tightly adherent bacteria on outer and luminal surfaces, and fewer adherent bacteria when outer surfaces alone were examined (p < .01). Scanning electron microscopy showed bacterial biofilm and adherence on the control catheters but not on the antiseptic catheters. There were no abnormal histopathologic changes associated with the test catheter, and serum concentrations of the antibacterial agents were shown to be within nontoxic ranges. ### conclusion The antiseptic-impregnated catheters prevented bacterial adherence and biofilm formation and produced no local or systemic toxicity."}

We sought to evaluate potential predictors for lipodystrophy according to each of the three definitions. ### methods We performed a cross-sectional study in the outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral hospital in Melbourne, Australia. We enrolled a total of 167 HIV-infected ambulatory patients over 3 months in mid-1998. Data on 159 males, 149 of whom were receiving triple combination antiretroviral therapy, were evaluated. Anthropometric measures, clinical examination, self-report of body shape changes, biochemical measures and DEXA scan were used to assess lipodystrophy and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients described body shape changes in the face, trunk, arms and legs. Laboratory parameters measured included fasting triglyceride (TG), cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), glucose, insulin, CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA. Current and past antiretroviral therapies were ascertained. ### results According to one proposed Australian national definition of lipodystrophy (LDNC), the prevalence of lipodystrophy in this population was 65%.

Patient-defined lipodystrophy (LDP), which involved a subjective assessment of thinning arms and legs and central adiposity, occurred in 19%.

The LDNC definition overestimated body shape abnormalities in comparison with patient perception. LAP was associated with significantly lower fat stores measured by anthropometry and DEXA scan than those identified under the LDNC definition. In contrast to LDNC, LAP was associated with d4T exposure, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and ZDV duration of use, but not PI use. Until a consensus definition for lipodystrophy is developed, including agreement on objective measurement and thresholds for abnormality, careful description of the individual components of the syndrome is required to enable cohort comparisons so that predictors of the syndrome can be assessed more accurately and outcome studies made feasible."}

To assess the potential of CoNS as putative reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes, we analysed the antimicrobial susceptibility of CoNS from dust and manure samples obtained in 41 pig farms in Germany, most of them (36 of 41) with a proven LA-MRSA/MSSA history. Among the 344 isolates analysed, 18 different CoNS species were identified and S. sciuri represented the most prevalent species (46%). High resistance rates were detected for tetracycline (71%), penicillin (65%) and oxacillin (64%) as well as fusidic acid (50%), which was mainly due to reduced susceptibility among S. sciuri isolates. S. sciuri exhibited pronounced multiresistance, and many isolates were characterised by the carriage of a number of uncommon (multi)resistance genes (e.g. cfr, apmA, fexA) and decreased susceptibility towards last resort antibiotics such as linezolid and daptomycin. The combined data suggest that S. sciuri harbours a significant resistance gene pool that requires further attention. We hypothesise that members of this species, due to their flexible lifestyle, might contribute to the spread of such genes in livestock environments."}

Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years with histologically confirmed, unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, WHO performance status 0-2, had received no previous therapy for metastatic disease, and had adequate organ function. Patients without disease progression after bevacizumab-based induction therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) by a minimisation technique to bevacizumab (7\u00b75 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or bevacizumab plus erlotinib (150 mg once daily) as maintenance therapy until progression. All patients were stratified by centre, baseline performance status, age, and number of metastatic sites.

Celecoxib was given daily beginning 5\u2009days before radiation followed by maintenance doses for 12\u2009weeks. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V3.0 and response with the World Health Organization system. Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose of celecoxib and treatment toxicity; secondary endpoints were response and survival rates. ### results The maximum tolerated dose of celecoxib was not reached, in part owing to discontinuation of the drug supply. At doses of 200 or 400\u2009mg/day, no patients experienced any dose-limiting toxicity (acute grade \u22654 esophagitis or pneumonitis, neutropenic fever or thrombocytopenia requiring transfusion, or acute grade \u22653 diarrhea). Grade 3 toxicities were leukopenia (five patients), fatigue (3), pneumonitis (2), dyspnea (1), pain (1), and esophageal stricture (1). Interestingly, pulmonary fibrosis (a late toxicity) was no more severe in the higher-dose (400-mg) group and may have been less common than in the lower-dose group. The clinical response rate was 100% (8 complete, 10 partial). Two-year rates were: overall survival 65%; local-regional control 69%; distant metastasis-free survival 71%; and disease-free survival 64%. ### conclusion Although preliminary, our results suggest that adding celecoxib to concurrent chemoradiation for inoperable NSCLC is safe and can improve outcome without increasing normal tissue toxicity."}

Unfortunately, even though the TKIs have been used for a long time, there are very few published data regarding the experience of TKI therapy in metastatic RCC (mRCC) from India. ### Materials And Methods This is a single institutional review of mRCC patients treated between January 2012 and July 2017. Patients who received at least 1 month of first-line TKIs were included for analysis of response rates, toxicity, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors. ### results Of the 40 mRCC patients, 31 (77.5%) were males. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range: 38-80 years). The most common site of metastasis was lungs (n = 24) followed by bone (n = 19) and liver (n = 7). Three patients had favorable risk disease, whereas 25 had intermediate risk and 12 had poor risk disease according to the MSKCC risk criteria. First-line TKI therapy used was sunitinib in 24, pazopanib in 11, and sorafenib in 5 patients. Toxicities of TKIs were Grade 1 or 2 in 13 patients and Grade 3 or 4 in 9 patients; the most common being fatigue, followed by hand-foot syndrome, skin rash, mucositis, and hypertension. Overall, 29 patients (72.5%) had disease control (complete responses in 1, partial responses in 10, and stable disease in 18 patients), whereas 11 had progression of disease at initial evaluation.

Capecitabine is a rationally designed oral prodrug that is converted into 5-FU by intracellular thymidine phosphorylase. Substitution of infusional 5-FU with capecitabine is an attractive option that provides a more convenient administration schedule and, possibly, increased efficacy. Indeed, incorporation of capecitabine in combined modality neoadjuvant therapy for LAR has been under intense investigation during the last 10 years. Phase I and II clinical trials showed that a regimen consisting of capecitabine 825mg/m(2) twice daily for 7 days/week continuous oral administration in combination with RT is an active and well tolerated regimen, thereby being the preferred concurrent regimen. The definitive demonstration that efficacy of capecitabine/RT is similar to 5-FU/RT has been provided by the NSABP-R-04 and the German Margit trials. One approach to improve outcomes in rectal cancer is to deliver a second RT-sensitizing drug with effective systemic activity. Oxaliplatin and irinotecan are therefore good candidates. However, two phase III trials demonstrated that incorporation of oxaliplatin to capecitabine with RT did not improve early outcomes and, by contrast, increased toxicity. Capecitabine has also been combined with irinotecan. This regimen showed encouraging results in phase I and II clinical trials, which led to an ongoing phase III clinical trial. New strategies with induction chemotherapy with or without chemoradiation prior to surgery are currently under investigation. Whether or not capecitabine has a role in this setting is being investigated in ongoing trials. Incorporation of agents directed towards new targets, such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies or antiangiogenic agents, in combination preoperative regimens, is being hampered by results of early trials in which efficacy outcomes with cetuximab were poor and an excessive rate of surgical complications with bevacizumab was observed. The lack of improvements in efficacy with the addition of cetuximab or bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer led to concerns about further development of these agents in rectal cancer. The role of capecitabine in the postoperative adjuvant setting is the aim of the ongoing Dutch SCRIPT trial. The prediction of response associated with capecitabine has been based on expression of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, as well as on gene expression arrays. All these procedures require further validation and should be considered as investigational. In conclusion, capecitabine can safely and effectively replace intravenous continuous infusion of 5-FU in the preoperative chemoradiation setting for rectal cancer management. The addition of other new antineoplastic agents to a fluoropyrimidine-based regimen remains investigational.", "abstract": "Preoperative infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and concurrent radiation therapy (RT) followed by total mesorectal surgery is the current standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer (LAR).

Indeed, incorporation of capecitabine in combined modality neoadjuvant therapy for LAR has been under intense investigation during the last 10 years. Phase I and II clinical trials showed that a regimen consisting of capecitabine 825mg/m(2) twice daily for 7 days/week continuous oral administration in combination with RT is an active and well tolerated regimen, thereby being the preferred concurrent regimen. The definitive demonstration that efficacy of capecitabine/RT is similar to 5-FU/RT has been provided by the NSABP-R-04 and the German Margit trials. One approach to improve outcomes in rectal cancer is to deliver a second RT-sensitizing drug with effective systemic activity. Oxaliplatin and irinotecan are therefore good candidates. However, two phase III trials demonstrated that incorporation of oxaliplatin to capecitabine with RT did not improve early outcomes and, by contrast, increased toxicity. Capecitabine has also been combined with irinotecan. This regimen showed encouraging results in phase I and II clinical trials, which led to an ongoing phase III clinical trial. New strategies with induction chemotherapy with or without chemoradiation prior to surgery are currently under investigation. Whether or not capecitabine has a role in this setting is being investigated in ongoing trials. Incorporation of agents directed towards new targets, such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies or antiangiogenic agents, in combination preoperative regimens, is being hampered by results of early trials in which efficacy outcomes with cetuximab were poor and an excessive rate of surgical complications with bevacizumab was observed. The lack of improvements in efficacy with the addition of cetuximab or bevacizumab in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer led to concerns about further development of these agents in rectal cancer. The role of capecitabine in the postoperative adjuvant setting is the aim of the ongoing Dutch SCRIPT trial. The prediction of response associated with capecitabine has been based on expression of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, as well as on gene expression arrays. All these procedures require further validation and should be considered as investigational. In conclusion, capecitabine can safely and effectively replace intravenous continuous infusion of 5-FU in the preoperative chemoradiation setting for rectal cancer management. The addition of other new antineoplastic agents to a fluoropyrimidine-based regimen remains investigational."}

Within 10 minutes of the first incision, however, there was a marked concordant rise in mean plasma ACTH and AVP levels for both procedures (conventional: ACTH, from a premedication value of 10.2 +/- 1.7 to 80.1 +/- 14.3 pmol/l, AVP from 1.2 +/- 0.4 to 117 +/- 24 pmol/l, P < 0.01 for both hormones; laparoscopic: ACTH from 5.8 +/- 2.6 to 55.1 +/- 26.0 pmol/l, AVP from 1.6 +/- 0.11 to 49.2 +/- 27.09 pmol/l). At the end of both types of operation mean levels of ACTH and AVP were still elevated, although the ACTH: AVP ratio had increased. Greater variability in ACTH and AVP responses was seen in the laparoscopic than in the conventional procedure, three patients showing a relatively small response to surgery. Total secretion of ACTH during both types of surgery was not significantly less both during (P < 0.05), and after (P < 0.01) laparoscopic surgery. For both procedures, the timing of AVP and ACTH peaks was significantly related (P < 0.002). A small but significant rise in CRH was observed 30 minutes after the start of surgery for both procedures P < 0.05). The timing of CRH and ACTH peaks was unrelated. The maximum mean plasma cortisol level for the conventional procedure (1268 +/- 147 nmol/l) was reached 20 minutes after reversal of anaesthesia and remained at this level until the end of sampling. The cortisol response was comparable during the laparoscopic procedure but was beginning to fall at 60 minutes post-operatively. Plasma adrenaline responses to the two types of surgery were not significantly different, but the plasma total noradrenaline response to laparoscopic surgery as indicated by the response area during the first 20 minutes was significantly increased (P < 0.02). Plasma sodium, renin activity and initial systolic blood pressure fall were not significantly different during the two procedures. ### conclusions For both procedures, the peak of ACTH secretion after incision is likely to be AVP dependent, and the timing of peak levels of these two hormones was significantly related. Subsequent ACTH secretion may be the result of an interaction between AVP and CRH. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in a smaller AVP rise than does the conventional procedure, and plasma AVP falls more rapidly post-operatively. During the period of observation, ACTH, CRH, cortisol and adrenaline responses were not significantly lessened by the laparoscopic approach, but there was a significant increase in the noradrenaline response. Stress hormone monitoring may assist further improvements in surgical technique."}

Dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events (AEs), maximum tolerated dose, and response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were assessed. ### results In the first cohort (3 patients given dulanermin at 4.5 mg/kg/d) and second cohort (6 patients given dulanermin at 9 mg/kg/day), no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The subsequent 14 patients were treated with a dulanermin dosage of 9 mg/kg/d. Patients (N = 23) received 2 to 42 cycles of dulanermin (median 15). The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs were neutropenia (39%), hypertension (17%), peripheral neuropathy (17%), hand-foot syndrome (13%), and pulmonary embolism (13%). Three patients (13%) discontinued the study because of serious AEs. Overall, a best response of partial response was observed in 13 patients (57%) (9 confirmed, 4 unconfirmed), stable disease was observed in 7 patients (30%), and disease progression was observed in 3 patients (13%). The median progression-free survival was 9.9 months (95% confidence interval, 7.0-12.7). ### conclusions Overall, the addition of dulanermin to first-line FOLFOX plus bevacizumab was well tolerated in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, with similar AEs that would be expected from FOLFOX plus bevacizumab. A randomized study is required to assess the clinical efficacy of dulanermin in this patient population."}

The current treatment of TB needs daily administration of combined drug therapy for six or more months. Sometime non-adherence and less bioavailability from current therapy develops multidrug resistance, as a result, high dose requirement and subsequent intolerable toxicity are seen. Therefore, nanotechnology gained special attention as it has potential to improve patient compliance, bioavailability and reduction in dosing frequency. ### objective The aim of this study is to fabricate alginate-chitosan nanoparticles (AL-CS NPs) under appropriate conditions using ionic gelation method. The use of natural polymers in nanoparticle fabrication has a vast application due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility and nontoxic nature. Ionic gelation method involves the interaction between macromolecules with opposite charged ionizable groups forming polyelectrolyte complex. Hence, it is rational to formulate natural polymerbased sustained release nano-particulate matrix to improve patient adherence, reducing dose frequency and drug toxicity. ### method The formulations were based on 32 factorial designs. Nanoparticles of combined drug (Isoniazid- INH and Pyrazinamide-PYZ) were fabricated using natural polymer. Formulation process involved the use of pregelated sodium alginate followed by ionic gelation with chitosan. Pregelation of sodium alginate included calcium chloride.

The 15 strains of the B. fragilis group were all beta-lactamase producers and were highly resistant to penicillin or the combination of penicillin and gentamicin. However, gentamicin reduced the MICs of clindamycin and metronidazole against 1 and 7 strains of this group, respectively. The in vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the sizes and bacterial content of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspensions. The results of the in vivo tests were generally consistent with those obtained in vitro with strains of the B. melaninogenicus group. Synergism between gentamicin and penicillin, clindamycin, or metronidazole was shown in 13, 10, and 3 strains of this group, respectively. In vivo synergism was not clearly demonstrated with the strains of the B. fragilis group, possibly because clindamycin and metronidazole used alone were highly efficacious. We suggest that the synergistic effect of gentamicin is due to its increased transport into the bacterial cell in the presence of penicillin and, possibly, other antimicrobial agents. The newly recognized in vitro and in vivo synergism between penicillin and other antimicrobial agents and an aminoglycoside in B. melaninogenicus may have clinical implications that deserve to be investigated."}

Leptin-mediated increases in the expression of FZD1 were blocked by pre-treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or the JAK2 inhibitor AG490. Experiments using a series of hybrid Epo extracellular domain-leptin intracellular domain receptors (ELR) harboring mutations of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail showed that increases in the expression of FZD1 were dependent on LRb-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3, but not ERK1/2 or STAT5. Leptin pre-treatment of chondrocytes prior to Wnt3a stimulation resulted in an increased magnitude of canonical Wnt signaling. ### conclusion These experiments show that leptin-LRb signaling in articular chondrocytes modulates expression of canonical Wnt signaling receptors and suggests that direct cross-talk between these pathways is important in determining chondrocyte homeostasis."}

The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are as effective as standard NSAIDs for the relief of pain and for improving function in elderly patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

The adverse reaction profile of the COX-2 inhibitors has confirmed the role of the COX-2 enzyme in renal function, salt and water homeostasis and the vascular endothelium. Thus, like standard NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause renal failure, hypertension and exacerbation of cardiac failure. Of note is that these disorders are dose related.

We investigated the proper dose of R-CHOP for them. ### methods At our institute, for DLBCL patients aged 65-79 and \u226580 years, we had reduced CHOP dose to 5/6 and 7/12, respectively, and retrospectively evaluated the reduced-dose R-CHOP. ### results Although the median age in the standard, 5/6, and 7/12-dose groups was 57, 73, and 84 years, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001), the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rate did not differ between the standard and 5/6-dose groups (60.2 and 56.7%); however, 7/12-dose group had significantly inferior survival (25.9%). When patients aged 60-80 were evaluated, no difference in EFS was observed between the standard and 5/6-dose groups using the same international prognostic index. The neutrophil nadir and the frequency of infection were comparable among the three dose groups. ### Discussion And Conclusions Reduced-dose R-CHOP chemotherapy is a promising treatment for elderly patients with DLBCL in terms of efficacy and toxicity."}

The purpose of our study was to compare the survival of porcine lung allografts after induction with either cyclosporine A (CsA) or tacrolimus. ### methods Single lung transplantation from MHC mismatched donors was performed in 10 minipigs. Immunosuppression included 1.5 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone and 1.0 mg/kg per day azathioprine. CsA (n=5) was adjusted to trough levels of 300-500 ng/ml, tacrolimus (n=5) was adjusted to 16-26 ng/ml. All immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued on postoperative day (POD) 28. Allograft survival was monitored by sequential chest radiographs, bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy histology. Peripheral blood leukocytes were scanned for donor chimerism and CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD25 expression. ### results The animals survived a 4-week course of immunosuppression without radiological or histological signs of rejection on POD 28. Median allograft survival in CsA-treated animals was 55+/-15 days and all animals rejected their grafts within 42 days after withdrawal of immunosuppression. In tacrolimus-treated animals, median survival was 152+/-65 days with the longest survivor being electively sacrificed on POD 390 (P=0.0064). The degree of donor leukocyte chimerism and the frequency of CD4+CD25+ T-cells were higher in the tacrolimus group, however, these differences were not statistically significant. ### conclusion The results of our study show that primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporine after pulmonary allotransplantation in a large animal model."}

Twenty-four months later, she was diagnosed with multiple bone metastases and underwent chemotherapy with paclitaxel and bevacizumab. Thirty-three months after the initiation of the chemotherapy, she noticed bilateral blurred vision. The retinal thickening with macular edema was observed by optical coherence tomography, resulting in a diagnosis of CME. With cessation of paclitaxel and administrating ocular instillation of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, her macular edema gradually reduced and disappeared in a month. While CME caused by chemotherapy is very rare, taxane may cause ocular adverse events such as CME. It is important to urge patients to consult an ophthalmologist promptly when they have visual complaints during taxane chemotherapy."}

Our re-analysis relied on standard equivalence methods in which interpretation is based on Relative Risks (RRs) along with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The equivalence margins employed in our statistical testing were directly derived from those reported in randomized studies. ### results The equivalence margins were initially set at RR ranging from 0.775 to 1.29.

The mean survival time to progression following the second line of treatment amounted to 5.85 and 6.2 months respectively. Statistically, a higher number of patients in good condition of 0 to 1 was documented in the group responding to treatment. Significant correlation was documented between primary stage of the disease and time to progression in patients treated with capecitabine (p = 0.0258). The recurrence of the disease was observed in 44/45 patients following operation with radical intention but with an insufficient number of excised lymph nodes. A significantly longer time to progression was observed in women treated with capecitabine. In logistic regression, lack of treatment response was found to be an independent factor affecting the time to disease progression. Patients who did not respond to the second line of treatment demonstrated a significantly shorter time to disease progression than patients who responded to it and they showed a significantly higher number of patients with leucopenia during treatment. ### conclusions Clinical response to treatment in both treated groups is of significant importance for the probability of local recurrence of the disease, preservation of a good patient's condition and the higher level of leukocytes during treatment."}
