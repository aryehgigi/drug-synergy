All patients received radiation encompassing at least 75% of the major salivary glands. Patients were randomized to receive radiation and carboplatin (RCT) alone or RCT preceded by rapid infusion of amifostine (500 mg) on days carboplatin was administered. The 14 patients who received amifostine, in comparison to 14 patients in the control arm, had significantly fewer episodes of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (p = 0.001), mucositis (p = 0.001), and xerostomia (p = 0.001). The patients receiving amifostine accrued significantly lower supportive care costs for resources related to infection ($241 vs. $1,275, p < 0.01), red blood cell and platelet support ($286 vs. $1,276 p = 0.06) alimentation ($343 vs. $894, p = .01), and hospitalization ($286 vs. $2,429, p < 0.01). Overall, including the costs of amifostine, mean per patient supportive care costs were $4,401 for the amifostine group and $5,873 (p = .02) for the control group. Our results from a randomized phase II trial indicate that selective cytoprotection with amifostine potentially offers clinical and economic benefits in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiochemotherapy. Additional economic studies alongside randomized phase III trials and from other countries are needed."}

All patients had previously been treated by surgery and conventional chemotherapy. Eight of them had also received irradiation at doses ranging from 45 to 55 Gy at the tumor site. At the time of transplantation, 9 patients were in first relapse, 5 in second relapse and 2 in third relapse or more; all had measurable disease; 15 patients were evaluable for response. No radiologic response > 50% was observed. Stable disease and progressive disease were documented in 10 and 5 cases, respectively. The duration of response to this treatment, which lasted for a median time of 7 months (range: 5-8 months), was only evaluable in 5 patients who did not receive further treatment after ABMT. To date, there are 3 disease-free survivors at 15, 25 and 27 months all of whom were treated with second complete surgical resection and local radiotherapy (55 Gy). Toxicity was severe, mainly digestive and cutaneous, and 1 toxicity-related death occurred. Unlike medulloblastomas, ependymomas do not appear to be sensitive to this combination therapy. New therapeutic approaches are warranted."}

Digoxin alone decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 11% (p = 0.04) and increased stroke work index by 44% (p = 0.01). The combination of captopril and digoxin resulted in a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac index and stroke work index both at rest and during exercise that was greater than values observed with either drug given alone. Cardiac index response to the combination of captopril and digoxin correlated with baseline serum aldosterone concentration (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) and plasma renin activity (r = 0.74, p less than 0.0002). A significant decrease in norepinephrine concentration was noted after digoxin was administered alone or added to captopril. These findings demonstrate that in patients with severe heart failure, the acute administration of captopril and digoxin has an independent salutary hemodynamic effect. The combination of these agents, however, has an adjunctive effect on cardiac function at rest and during exercise."}

The response rate to Adriamycin was significant better than the response to vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide (P = 0.03, two-sided). The respective median survivals on the three treatments were 37, 34, and 41 weeks and were not significantly different. Moderate or severe vomiting occurred in 60% of patients receiving vincristine-cyclophosphamide-adriamycin, a greater frequency than in Adriamycin alone (P = .09 two-sided) Severe or life-threatening hematologic toxicity (leukocytes less than 2000, platelets less than 50,000) occurred in 30% of patients receiving the Adriamycin combination, a markedly increased frequency when compared to the other two regimens (P equals 0.07, P = 0.02, two-sided). This trial establishes that Adriamycin has a better response rate than the combination of vincristine-actinomycin-D-cyclophosphamide in advanced sarcomas. The combination of vincristine, Adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide increased toxicity and did not add to the therapeutic effect achieved with Adriamycin alone."}

There is currently no consensus on the most suitable treatment for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation. This open, multicenter, retrospective, uncontrolled cohort study was designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combined use of a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor and sorafenib in this setting. In 31 patients who suffered from HCC recurrence after liver transplantation, the immunosuppressive therapy was changed to mTOR inhibitors, and systemic treatment with sorafenib was initiated. This combination was maintained until symptomatic tumor progression, death, hepatic decompensation, or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Primary treatment efficacy was determined by overall survival and progression-free survival, and secondary efficacy was determined by the overall response rate. Toxicity parameters associated with the use of sorafenib and mTOR inhibitors were also analyzed. The overall response rate according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was 3.8% (1/26), and there was sustained stabilization of the disease in 13 additional cases (50.0%). The median overall survival was 19.3 months [95% confidence interval (CI) = 13.4-25.1 months], and the median time to progression was 6.77 months (95% CI = 2.3-11.1 months). Only 2 grade 3/4 cases of hyperglycemia and 1 case of grade 3/4 mucositis were reported, and they were possibly related to mTOR inhibitors. The most common severe adverse event probably related to sorafenib was diarrhea (12.9%). In conclusion, the coadministration of sorafenib and an mTOR inhibitor could be effective despite notable toxicity in patients with post-liver transplant HCC recurrence not suitable for radical therapy. The toxicity and efficacy need to be further evaluated in randomized controlled studies for this combination to be considered a valid option."}

We investigated the pharmacokinetics of carboplatin in Japanese prostate cancer patients (n=10, 55-72 years), and evaluated the usefulness of Calvert's formula in the individualized dosing adjustment. They were intravenously administered carboplatin (area under the free plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)=5 mg.min/ml), following the intravenous administration of paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)). The dosage of carboplatin for each patient was determined with Calvert's formula using individual creatinine clearance values. Plasma concentration of total platinum was measured sequentially and the pharmacokinetic parameters of carboplatin were determined in each patient. Plasma concentration of total carboplatin after intravenous infusion well fitted the two-compartment model. Carboplatin clearance was 62.0+/-12.7 ml/min (mean+/-S.D.), and linearly related to the individual creatinine clearance (r(2)=0.64, p<0.01). The actual AUC for total carboplatin was 8.20+/-1.11 mg.min/ml, and its inter-individual variability was decreased to 65% of that in carboplatin clearance, indicating the effectiveness of Calvert's formula for dosage adjustment of carboplatin. Leucopenia of grade 4 according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria was found in one patient, but no patient demonstrated thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, determining carboplatin dosage based on Calvert's formula decreased the inter-individual variability in the actual AUC compared with that in the carboplatin clearance, and a target AUC of 5 mg.min/ml of carboplatin was comparatively safe for Japanese patients with prostate cancer."}
