Cardiac events occurred after posaconazole administration, incriminating posaconazole use, alone or in combination with voriconazole, as the culpable agent. ### Case Report A 26-year-old female patient underwent orthopedic surgery to remove ectopic calcifications in her left hip joint. On the first post-operative day she became septic due to a surgical wound infection. Despite being treated according to the therapeutic protocols for sepsis, no clinical improvement was noticed and further assessment revealed an underlying immunodeficiency. Considering the underlying immunodeficiency and to that point poor clinical response, an antifungal agent was added to the antibiotic regiment. Following discontinuation of multiple antifungal agents due to adverse effects, posaconazole was administered. Posaconazole oral intake was followed by episodes of bradycardia and QT interval prolongation. The patient suffered continuous incidents of cardiac arrest due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades des pointes) that degenerated to lethal ventricular fibrillation. Posaconazole was immediately discontinued and a temporary pacemaker was installed. The patient finally recovered without any neurological deficit, and was discharged in a good clinical status. ### conclusions Close cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases where posaconazole administration is combined with coexisting risk factors, as they may lead to severe ECG abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias such as long QT interval syndrome and torsades de pointes. Posaconazole interactions with medications metabolized via the CYP3A4 pathway should be considered an additional risk factor for lethal cardiac incidents."}

To determine an OBD (based on a gene re-expression end point), 14 patients received decitabine alone for 10 days. To determine the MTD, 11 patients received decitabine (at OBD, days 1 through 10) plus dose-escalating VA (days 5 through 21). ### results The OBD of decitabine was 20 mg/m(2)/d intravenously, with limited nonhematologic toxicity. In patients treated with decitabine plus VA, dose-limiting encephalopathy occurred in two of two patients at VA 25 mg/kg/d and one of six patients at VA 20 mg/kg/d. Drug-induced re-expression of estrogen receptor (ER) was associated with clinical response (P < or = .05). ER promoter demethylation, global DNA hypomethylation, depletion of DNA methyltransferase enzyme, and histone hyperacetylation were also observed. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the response rate was 44% (11 of 25). Of 21 assessable patients, 11 (52%) responded: four with morphologic and cytogenetic complete remission (CR; each had complex karyotype), four with incomplete CR, and three with partial remission. In untreated AML, four of nine assessable patients achieved CR. Clinical responses appeared similar for decitabine alone or with VA. ### conclusion Low-dose decitabine was safe and showed encouraging clinical and biologic activity in AML, but the addition of VA led to encephalopathy at relatively low doses. On the basis of these results, additional studies of decitabine (20 mg/m(2)/d for 10 days) alone or with an alternative deacetylating agent are warranted."}

Clopidogrel was stopped after 30 days and aspirin continued. Recurrent events were ascertained at face-to-face follow-up. ### results A total of 320 patients were prescribed a 30-day course of aspirin and clopidogrel acutely after TIA or minor stroke. There were 5 recurrent ischemic strokes and 7 TIAs during the aspirin and clopidogrel treatment period, but no strokes and 4 TIAs during the 30 days after stopping clopidogrel.

This inhibition leads to a reduction in angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction and aldosterone production. Although converting enzyme inhibitors have other potential metabolic effects, their beneficial effects in hypertension and congestive heart failure appear to be, in large part, related to their ability to reduce angiotensin II. This causes an increase in plasma renin levels and a fall in plasma and urine aldosterone, which can be sustained for many years. As a consequence, converting enzyme inhibitors produce mild natriuresis and positive potassium balance. At conventionally used doses, enalapril more completely prevents posture-induced increases in aldosterone than does captopril, probably reflecting more complete inhibition of angiotensin II formation in vivo."}

In this study, we investigated the role of methylation in reduced XPC in melanoma. ### methods To reduce methylation and induce DNA-damage, melanoma cell lines were treated with decitabine and carboplatin, individually and sequentially. Global DNA methylation levels, XPC mRNA and protein expression and methylation of the XPC promoter were examined. Apoptosis, cell proliferation and senescence were also quantified. XPC siRNA was used to determine that the responses seen were reliant on XPC induction. ### results Treatment with high-dose decitabine resulted in global demethylation, including the the shores of the XPC CpG island and significantly increased XPC mRNA expression. Lower, clinically relevant dose of decitabine also resulted in global demethylation including the CpG island shores and induced XPC in 50% of cell lines. Decitabine followed by DNA-damaging carboplatin treatment led to significantly higher XPC expression in 75% of melanoma cell lines tested. Combined sequential treatment also resulted in a greater apoptotic response in 75% of cell lines compared to carboplatin alone, and significantly slowed cell proliferation, with some melanoma cell lines going into senescence. Inhibiting the increased XPC using siRNA had a small but significant negative effect, indicating that XPC plays a partial role in the response to sequential decitabine and carboplatin. ### conclusions Demethylation using decitabine increased XPC and apoptosis after sequential carboplatin.

There is, however, concern about the risk of second malignancies (SM) in long-term survivors. We have analyzed the second malignancies in patients treated in the German Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. ### Materials And Methods From January 1981 through June 1991, 674 patients were registered in the two sequential multicentric Ewing's sarcoma trials CESS 81 (recruitment period 1981-1985) and CESS 86 (1986-1991).

The median follow-up at the time of this analysis was 5.1 years, the maximum follow-up 16.5 years. ### results The overall survival of all patients including metastatic patients was 55% after 5 years, 48% after 10 years, and 37% after 15 years. Eight out of 674 patients (1.2%) developed a SM. Five of these were acute myelogenic leukemias (n = 4) or MDS (n = 1), and three were sarcomas. The interval between diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma and the diagnosis of the SM was 17-78 months for the four AMLs, 96 months for the MDS and 82-136 months for the three sarcomas. The cumulative risk of an SM was 0.7% after 5 years, 2.9% after 10 years, and 4.7% after 15 years. Out of five patients with AML/MDS, three died of rapid AML-progression, and two are living with disease. Local therapy (surgery vs. surgery plus postoperative irradiation vs. definitive radiotherapy) had no impact on the frequency of AML/MDS, but local therapy did influence the risk of secondary sarcomas. All three patients with secondary sarcomas had received radiotherapy; however, all three sarcomas were salvaged by subsequent treatment and are in clinical remission with a follow-up of 1 month, 4.3 years, and 7.5 years after the diagnosis of the secondary sarcoma. Thus far, SM contributed to less than 1 % (3/328) of all deaths in the CESS-studies. ### conclusions The risk of leukemia after treatment for Ewing's sarcoma is probably in the range of 2%.

Pooled data were then retrospectively analysed according to objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ### results One hundred and five patients were included in the study. Twelve had achieved partial response (PR) (11.4%), 24 stable disease (SD; 22.9%) and 69 progressive disease (PD; 65.7%). Patients with PR/SD had lower IHC scores and higher MB levels than those with PD. MGMT expression by IHC was negatively and MB levels positively associated with PFS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and 0.004, respectively), but not with OS. By combining both assays, IHC low/MB high patients displayed an 87% reduction in the hazard of progression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a 77% in the hazard for death (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). ### conclusion In mCRC selected for MGMT deficiency by MSP, IHC and MB testing improve clinical outcome to alkylating agents.

Consenting patients with newly diagnosed, resectable, high-grade osteosarcoma aged 40 years or younger were eligible for randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either postoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (MAP) or MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE) using concealed permuted blocks with three stratification factors: trial group; location of tumour (proximal femur or proximal humerus vs other limb vs axial skeleton); and presence of metastases (no vs yes or possible). The MAP regimen consisted of cisplatin 120 mg/m ### findings Between April 14, 2005, and June 30, 2011, 2260 patients were registered from 325 sites in 17 countries. 618 patients with poor response were randomly assigned; 310 to receive MAP and 308 to receive MAPIE. Median follow-up was 62\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b76-76\u00b76); 62\u00b73 months (IQR 46\u00b79-77\u00b71) for the MAP group and 61\u00b71 months (IQR 46\u00b75-75\u00b73) for the MAPIE group. 307 event-free survival events were reported (153 in the MAP group vs 154 in the MAPIE group). 193 deaths were reported (101 in the MAP group vs 92 in the MAPIE group). Event-free survival did not differ between treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b798 [95% CI 0\u00b778-1\u00b723]); hazards were non-proportional (p=0\u00b70003). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (268 [89%] patients in MAP vs 268 [90%] in MAPIE), thrombocytopenia (231 [78% in MAP vs 248 [83%] in MAPIE), and febrile neutropenia without documented infection (149 [50%] in MAP vs 217 [73%] in MAPIE). MAPIE was associated with more frequent grade 4 non-haematological toxicity than MAP (35 [12%] of 301 in the MAP group vs 71 [24%] of 298 in the MAPIE group). Two patients died during postoperative therapy, one from infection (although their absolute neutrophil count was normal), which was definitely related to their MAP treatment (specifically doxorubicin and cisplatin), and one from left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which was probably related to MAPIE treatment (specifically doxorubicin). One suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction was reported in the MAP group: bone marrow infarction due to methotrexate. ### interpretation EURAMOS-1 results do not support the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to postoperative chemotherapy in patients with poorly responding osteosarcoma because its administration was associated with increased toxicity without improving event-free survival. The results define standard of care for this population.

There were no statistical differences between the two groups with respect to duration of hospitalization or mortality. The cost of antibiotic therapy (including prophylaxis and treatment of infections) was significantly higher in group 2. ### conclusion These results suggest that the addition of intravenous ceftriaxone during the first 3 days of hospitalization does not improve the cost-efficacy of oral norfloxacin in the prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding and high risk of infection."}

Furthermore, 11 AML patients at primary diagnosis, including five AML patients with P-gp overexpression, who were treated with idarubicin, vepesid, and cytarabine V (ara-C) showed a complete remission. Additionally, one daunorubicin-cytarabine-pretreated refractory AML patient was treated with the oral form of the P-gp modulator drug dexniguldipine and achieved complete remission for a duration of 7 months. Our results suggest that in CML patients in BC, P-gp expression influences outcome after therapy. Further more, studies in a larger series of patients are necessary to prove the efficacy and toxicity of idarubicin/vepesid and cytardbine--or dexniguldipine-containing--therapy in relation to P-gp expression of AML patients."}

In this phase Ib trial we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of pemetrexed, carboplatin, bavituximab in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ### Patients And Methods Patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC and performance status 0 or 1 were treated with pemetrexed 500 mg/m ### results Between March 29, 2011 and December 30, 2013, 26 patients were enrolled. Three patients each were enrolled into dose escalation cohorts of bavituximab (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). Therapy was well tolerated with no DLTs, and toxicities were consistent with those expected from pemetrexed/carboplatin. Overall response was 28%, with a median progression-free and overall survival of 4.8 months and 12.2 months, respectively. ### conclusion The combination of pemetrexed, carboplatin, bavituximab is well tolerated. However, with toxicities and preliminary efficacy signal similar to pemetrexed/carboplatin alone, further studies of bavituximab should focus on ways to enhance its immunomodulatory role."}

Patients with prior immunotherapy or metastasectomy were excluded. Multiple imputation and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to account for missing values and imbalances between the treatment groups, respectively. Unadjusted and adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to determine differences in progression-free (PFS), overall (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). ### results Overall, 104 (40%) patients received CN before TKI treatment.

We found no difference in survival outcomes between patients treated with and without CN before TKI therapy. However, CN was associated with improved survival in specific patient subgroups. Tailored, individualized treatment is key to further improve oncological outcomes for mRCC."}
